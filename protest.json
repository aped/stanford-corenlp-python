Today was the start of the G20 summit. It happens every\nyear and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run\ntheir governments effectively and what not. Since there are so many leaders coming together\ntheir are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government\nthey follow so they protest. There was a protest that happened along the street where I work\nand at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot.\nPolice cars were burned and things were thrown at cops. Police were in full riot gear to\nalleviate the violence. As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the\nrioters while they smash windows of stores. And this all happened right in front of my store\nwhich was kind of scary but it was kind of interesting since I've never seen a riot before.\nSince it all happened in front of close to my store, my coworkers and I were stuck in the\nstore until it was safe to come out so we saw everything happen from start to finish. Sucks\nthat everything they were protesting is now a lost cause since everyone will just remember the\nriot and violence they created. However, I bet the police wanted this to happen just to\njustify that the money they spent for the extra security was well worth it.</div>"], ["A Blog in Two Parts (Part 2)", "http://www.travelblog.org/Europe/Russia/Northwest/Saint-Petersburg/blog-543602.html", "Travel Blog | Travel Journals, Diaries and Photos", "http://travelblog.org/Bloggers/traceyp", "<br />\n<br />\nI had intended to write this second part on Sunday night when I wrote the first part, however\nI was so tired that I decided to go to sleep and write this entry the next day (Monday). I\nhadn't planned on meeting up with some friends at a bar chain called \"SPB\" (as St. Petersburg\nis called by the locals) and drinking 2 liters of beer! So here I am 2 days later finally\nsitting down and finishing this entry.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nSunday morning we had a program excursion to the Dostoevsky Museum. Our resident director,\nKathryn, tries to schedule one excursion each week and these are already paid for by our\nprogram fees. So I met the group at the Vladimirskaya metro stop. For reference, I live at\nOzerki, on the blue line; see metro map here:\n\n<br />\n<br />\nhttp://www.saint-petersburg.com/transport/metro/map.asp\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe museum is housed in Dostoevsky's apartment, but there are only a few items that actually\nbelonged to him. The rest of the furniture and other things are just period pieces. It was\ninteresting, but I wouldn't have paid for it. After we left we went on a tour around the area\nand were shown the apartment where he lived while writing Crime and Punishment, the place\nwhere his character Raskolnikov lived, and the apartment building where Raskolnikov committed\nhis murder. I enjoyed the walking tour more than the apartment, especially since we were able\nto enjoy a rare day of sunshine.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nOnce the tour was over everyone went their own way. My friend Emily and I went to an Asian\nchain called, \"Dve Palochki\" (2 Sticks), to eat. It is an interesting chain. All the servers\nare male and wear t-shirts with funny phrases on the back. They also have TV monitors showing\narrival and departure times at the airport. I have no idea why since most of the restaurants\nare located far away from the airport. Very random.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nEmily was killing time before she went to mass at 7 so we had a few hours to walk around the\ncity centre area. The weather was great on Sunday so we walked quite a bit (I'm still worn out\nfrom all the walking I did this weekend) before we bid each other adieu and went our separate\nways. I walked to my favorite pirogi place, \"Stolle\". They have the BEST pies! I had one with\nmushrooms (Russia has the BEST mushrooms) and one with tvorog, a kind of sweet cheese filling\nsimilar to what you would find in a cheese danish. SOOOOOO good! Once I finished and drank my\ncoffee I decided to head down to Palace Square to take some pics at night and then walk across\nthe Neva to take the Gor'kovskaya metro back home.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nStolle isn't far from Palace Square so I was there under 10 minutes. As I came around the\ncorner I saw a small group of people standing around the Alexander Column with a few vans.\nThere was also some people flying a kite so I thought is was some kind of tour group and\nwalked closer to see where they were from. As I got closer I noticed that the group of people\nwere handing out pamphlets and seemed to be discussing something and that the vans I saw from\nthe distance were actually police vehicles. We had noticed a very heavy police presence\nthroughout the day and wondered about it, but it wasn't until I saw the police surrounding\nthis group that I put two and two together. This was a political protest! Every 31st day of\nmonths with 31 days the various groups that make up the opposition to Putin and Medvedev try\nto stage rallies in the bigger cities of Russia (Art. 31 of the Russian Constitution\nguarantees freedom of assembly). They always apply for permits and are always turned down for\none reason or another so that the police have a reason to disperse the crowd and there is\nusually some violence. The new mayor of Moscow had actually permitted a rally in that city\n(limited to 800 people) but the St. Petersburg regime did not. Even so, from what I saw it\nwasn't very rowdy and the police did not need to use much force. Of course they never pass up\nan opportunity to flog the opposition and I saw one kid (literally, he couldn't have been\nolder than 18 or 19) with what would soon be a black eye. That's before the police threw him\ninto one of the vans along with a few other of the more vocal protesters (including an old\nwoman) and drove them away while the crowd chanted \"It's our city\".\n\n<br />\n<br />\nIn truth it was quite a pathetic rally. There weren't very many people. In fact, the police\noutnumbered the protesters at least 2-1 (not to mention the sinister riot police waiting in\nthe wings in their storm trooper gear). There were also more journalists and onlookers (myself\nbeing one) than actual protesters. I guess this is what comes from having the entire weight of\nthe state thrown upon you. Anna Politkovskaya wrote of an atomised society where individuals\nonly care about their own life and the instant gratification to be derived from it while the\ngovernment plays a bit of divide and rule and puts on a great show of democracy while not\nactually adhering to those values which define a democracy. Especially freedom of expression\nand freedom to gather in public areas. Even many of the people who did show up didn't seem to\ntake it all that seriously. The young man with the black eye was positively smiling for the\ncameras as he was being taken away. There was another man dressed in blue with a plastic head\nsticking out of his sweater. When I asked him why he was dressed like that he said that he\ncouldn't say at the moment but we would find out in December. As he walked around the police\njust smiled and laughed. Maybe there were even more attention seekers than actual protesters.\nMy heart was with those who actually wanted a change in the way Russia is governed\n(incompetently and corruptly) and I talked to a few but I doubt that my scholarship program\nwould approve of that kind of participation in Russian society. Anyway, after standing there\nfor an hour and talking to journalists, protesters, and onlookers I was most impressed by the\nseeming surrender of those not involved in the protest. The most common line I heard was \"It's\ngood to try to do something, but nothing will change.\" I walked past the ominous grey armored\ntruck carrying those jack-booted storm-troopers as I made my way off of Palace Square and back\ntoward the metro. The first song I listened to on my ipod as I rode the metro home was the\nClash's version of \"I Fought the Law\".\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThere's an article on the Moscow protest with a little back story here:\n\nPrevious Entry \n\n<div class='articlehead'><b>Copyright Notice: All Rights Reserved</b></div>\n\n<div class='articlebody'>\n<div id='cms_1'>The text and photos of this article remain the copyright of the Author (Adam\nYosef).

I saw\napproximately 60 people loaded into ambulance boats to be ferried to hospitals, and the\ninjured police outnumbered civilians about 2:1. A few of the injuries appeared quite\nsignificant. Earlier in the evening, crowds on the bridge had unguarded access to several\nmilitary vehicles on the bridge and vandalized them. One American couple I talked to said they\nsaw protesters near Khao San Road throwing \"molotov cocktails\" and firing guns at the\npolice.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, these caveats: I don't speak the language, I don't know the ground, I talked to almost\nno one, and I tried to honor the spirit of my promise to my family to stay clear of the\nprotests by keeping some distance when the action came to me. My understanding of what I saw\nis necessarily very limited, and the broader pictured painted by the professional media is\nalready different from what I observed in one spot.<br />\n<br />\nI didn't get close enough to get very good pix in the dark. I have some video but won't be\nable to upload it until I'm at a better computer set up.<br />\n<br />\nAt about 5 p.m. Saturday, I walked out on to Phrapinklao Bridge to see if I could observe the\nprotests in the distance down Phrapinklao Road, which was closed to four-wheel traffic.\n(Motorbikes and tuk-tuks seem to be able to go into barricaded streets.) About that time, some\nprotesters were beginning to cross on foot toward the rallies. About 6 military vehicles --\nbuses, jeeps and trucks -- were left unattended on the bridge, apparently by police or\nsoldiers who had walked into the city earlier. Navy boats, some with cannons, were patrolling\nbelow the bridge, and a military helicopter flying over the protest area occasionally came\nnear. The pedestrian traffic began to accumulate to jeer the boats and helicopter and then\nbegan to vandalize the vehicles parked there -- tires flattened, wires ripped out from under\nthe hood and water poured into the oil reservoir. Children were playing in the driver's seats\nof the buses. Later in the evening I saw one of the buses on fire.<br />\n<br />\nAt about 7 p.m., ambulances, usually a pickup truck with about 4 medics riding in back, began\nrallying in the street underneath the bridge, heading toward the protest sites and returning\nwith the injured to carry them to ambulance boats waiting at the pier underneath the bridge.\nAbout 5 boats were queued up in the water at a given time.<br />\n<br />\nPolice or soldiers in riot gear were the significant majority of who I saw brought in. Many\nlimped to the pier under their own steam, their injuries not apparent, presumably affected by\ntear gas. Many were carried on stretchers. Some were quite bloodied up. I saw one civilian\nbeing given chest compressions. Two civilians were laid down on the cement to be bandaged\ninstead of being taken directly to the boats, and their hair was soaked in blood. One police\nor soldier apparently had a broken leg that needed to be splinted before he was moved.<br />\n<br />\nFor about one hour, I counted about one arrival every 3-4 minutes. Beginning about 8 p.m. and\nfor about 30 minutes, there were usually more than 2 ambulances on the scene at a time, and it\nwas quite chaotic getting the injured to the boats. Sometimes, a tuk-tuk or hired motorbike\nwould arrive with passengers who were apparently asking after the wounded and then running\ndown to the pier. About 8:30, the ambulances on the scene began to leave without unloading\ntheir injured and other ambulances raced by without stopping, presumably to another rally\npoint or hospital.<br />\n<br />\nIt began to quiet down under Phrapinklao Bridge at that point. In places the pavement was\nstained with blood and littered with rubber gloves and bandages. Piles of shields, batons and\nother riot gear were left behind.<br />\n<br />\nAs of 9:45 I can still hear sirens on Phra Athit Road.<br />\n<br />\nI also saw signs of violence earlier in the day. In a taxi on the way to Phra Athit Road ffrom\nthe northern part of the city at about 3 p.m., the taxi got stuck in a traffic jam near the\nwestern end of Si Ayuthaya Road, which was blocked to four-wheel traffic. As I walked a few\nblocks south through the jam, I couldn't see the protests in the distance. An ambulance became\nstuck in the traffic near there, and while it was stuck, a motorbike driver came up Si\nAyuthaya with a passenger holding a bloody bandage to his head. When a medic jumped out of the\nambulance to help him in, I could see that his shirt was already bloodied from a previous\ncase.<br />\n<br />\nDuring that time, some local people were standing around on the sidewalk watching in the\ndirection of the protests and listening to handheld radios, looking more concerned than they\nhad earlier in the day and yesterday. But for the most part, the rest of the city has seemed\nremarkably unaffected by the protests in their midst. I've had 3 different taxi drivers seem\ngenuinely surprised after a month of protests to find themselves stuck in traffic. Street\nmarkets and other commerce are carrying on like normal, even quite near the protests. Whenever\na few soldiers are seen waiting around, nobody pays any attention to them. Tonight, just\nbeyond the line of ambulance boats and navy boats, regular dinner cruise boats continued\npassing back and and forth. Some TVs and radios in public places are tuned to the news\ncoverage, but not all.<br />\n<br />\nOver the past couple weeks in the north and even in Laos, I frequently saw people gathered\naround televisions in bus stations and cafes to watch \"red shirt TV,\" the channel broadcasting\nthe protesters speeches. That's the same channel that the government forced off the air two\ndays ago and again yesterday after the protesters briefly took control of the TV station and\nhad it back on the air.<br />\n<br />\n-<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Robert</span></div>"], ["Greg S; Arrested at the Esplanade | G20 Stories", "http://g20stories.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/greg_s/", "G20 Stories", "http://g20stories.wordpress.com", "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<div class='snap_preview'>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Name:</strong></span> Greg S.<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Age:</strong></span> 24<br />\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Occupation:</strong></span> Construction and\nrenovations</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Purpose of Attendance</strong></span></p>\n<p>I went to the rally in order to protest my extreme dissatisfaction with global governance,\nthe pillaging of the poor to further the interests of the elite.

Once there we sat down in the street and continued to chant and sing. It was around\n8:30 PM. After 5 minutes or so, a line of police dressed in riot gear, including gas masks,\nappeared in front of us and sealed off that end of the street. <span\nid=\"more-85\"></span>People were becoming nervous that we would be boxed in, so a discussion\nwas had with the police about allowing us to continue our march. An officer, I'm assuming some\ntype scene commander or supervisor, told the person negotiating on our behalf that would be\nallowed to continue if everyone in the crowd would flash a peace sign with our hands. We did\nthis, although it took a few minutes, and during these few minutes another police line formed\nbehind us sealing us in.</p>\n<p>At this point it was around 9 PM, the riot police then began hitting their shields and\nsqueezing us tighter and tighter together. Not one person here was violent, aside from the\npolice. We continued to sit in the street chanting \"Peaceful protest\" and other chants of that\nnature. The police continued to close in on us telling us to disperse. We responded saying you\nhave us boxed in we can't disperse but the police would only respond with, \"Disperse now, or\nyou will be arrested.\" We were boxed in, and were unable to disperse. The police began\ngrabbing single people at random. I was one of those people. I was sitting in the street\nexercising my Charter Right to peacefully assemble and express my opinion when I was grabbed.\nI had my arm twisted nearly out of it's socket, zip tied, had leg shackles put on and sat in\nthe wet street and on-and-off again rain for 2 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Sunday</em></p>\n<p>I was taken to the Eastern Avenue detention center at around 11:45-12:00, although I am not\ntoo sure of the time as the officers wouldn't tell me. When the two full buses arrived, there\nwas a person being loaded into an ambulance which took off minutes after we arrived. We were\nthen transferred to some type of preliminary cell that was around 3?5 meters in size, and\ncontained a door-less port-o-potty. We remained in zip ties, so as you can imagine going to\nthe bathroom was rather difficult. I was held here for maybe 1.5-2 hours, at which point I was\ntransferred to another cell of the same specifications, but this time next to warehouse\nshelving and the prisoner processing trailers. At this point I had maybe 4 ounces of water and\nno food.</p>\n<p>I sat in that cell for not long, maybe an hour, when I was taken into a processing trailer\nto finally be informed of my rights and why I was being held. Inside the trailer I was told I\nwas \"lucky\" that I was being held on a breach of the peace, which the officer said was not a\ncriminal offence or even a charge, but they could detain me. He made zero mention of the 24\nhour time limit and also told me that I would be allowed to speak to a lawyer when I was put\nin my new cage. The officers, to this point, had been very nice, and respectful, as much as\nthis type of situation permits.</p>\n<p>I was placed into the cell where I spent the bulk of my time. This cell was about 6?8 feet\nbeing 8 feet high. There was no bathroom, or benches, just a dirty concrete floor. They placed\n6 people in this cage, including me; I heard from others down the row that they had up to 7\npeople in theirs. It was standing room only and we had to stay there for around 15-18 hours.\nAt this point I began demanding access to a lawyer. I had been asking the entire time, but now\nthat I had been processed there is no excuse for me not to have a lawyer. The vast majority of\nthe guards told me they were \"working on it,\" whatever that means, or that all the phones were\nin use. I would say it is my Charter Right to have access to a lawyer upon detention without\ndelay and that they are violating my Charter Rights. Most would ignore me; some would mock and\nlaugh at me. One officer, whom I talked to most of the shift, finally relented and allowed me\nto use the phone an hour or two before I was released. At this point it was around 3 in the\nafternoon on Sunday June 27. When I got into the phone room, there were around 20 pay phones\nand, to my surprise, not a single one was in use. I asked the guard why I had been lied to the\nentire time and he told me that there are not enough guards to allow people to use the phones.\nI was released shortly after and made to walk to the street before putting on my shoes.\nLuckily I got my shoes back?a guy detained with me had his shoes lost by the police and they\nkicked him out in his socked feet.</p>\n<p>As far as injuries I saw go, there were a lot of people bleeding, bruised or having dry\nblood all over their clothes. I can't speak to how they received these injuries since I didn't\nsee the events and they generally only described how they were beaten, and not the\nprecipitating events. The entire time in detention I did not sleep; around 36 hours of no\nsleep, 22 of which I spent being detained. I had maybe (and this is a big maybe) ? of a liter\nof water the entire time, a couple sandwiches which I did not eat because they had no\nnutritional value. The cages were freezing cold. I was shivering most of the time and the\nguards refused to give anyone blankets. What compounded the temperature issue was we were all\nwet, had no shoes and the concrete floors just suck heat right out of you, especially when\nyou're wet.<br />\nI have more from my day of experiences but the arrest and detention were the most flagrant\nviolations of my rights that weekend.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Overall Experience &amp;\nLessons</strong></span></p>\n<p>From when I arrived there was an extremely tense atmosphere; everyone was on edge. People\nwere worried about violence, mostly from the police. We were bullied and harassed the entire\nday and the police made peaceful protests impossible. I now live in fear that I am on some\ntype of watch list. I am scared that my house will be raided or that charges will still be\nlaid, even though all I did was exercise my chart rights.

I can only start from the beginning. In Corinth, while I was taking\nmy course, I heard from my students that there had been rioting in Athens and that there were\nprotests planned for Corinth. I asked my students the only logical question, why? They said\nall schools had been canceled for the following day because a little boy had been shot. Been\nshot by whom, I wondered. \"By the police\" my students said. I was immediately interested in\nthis situation that had been bubbling in Greece and so I researched it online to try and\nunderstand it better. Firstly, any heart felt person would instinctually say, \"Well, the\npolice shot a 16 year old boy, of course the society is rising up in protest. This is the\nreason.\" and they would be right, but it is not that easy.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe boy, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, was killed in the Exarchia district of central Athens. This\nis primarily a leftist region in the capital of a politically passionate and opinion fueled\ncountry. And to walk through Excarchia one would see that although it is safe and does not\nmimic a \"ghetto\" it is not the glitz and glam of its neighboring areas. It is crumbling and\nthe decoration consists of elaborately stunning spray art on the walls and alleys. Currently\nGreece has a conservative government in parliament and like most nations, the Greek populace\nis feeling the burden of the global economic crisis heavily. Much of this society is\nfinancially depressed and out of work, paid low wages if they are in work and sincerely\ndisappointed with the government policy or lack thereof regarding this and other issues. Any\nlocal Athenian, involved in the struggle or not, will tell you straight up, Alex was a\ncatalyst for something that had been brewing. As we would say in English \"the straw that broke\nthe camel's back.\" It is true, the fighting is in Alex's name, they are saying \"you cannot\nkill our children\" and \"we resist your abuse of power\" but they are also saying this perverse\nand abusive structure that plagues our society has got to stop, we need to be heard. Alex has\nbecome a symbol for so much more than his sad and untimely death.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe day after my students told me that a rally had been planned in Corinth, as it had been in\nmany cities across Greece, I walked out to the street for my lunch hour off of school. I\ninstantly noticed that the revolutionary strategy of physical damage to property had found its\nway to the center of Corinth. Corinth, though, was different from Athens in that all damage\nhad been kept solely to banks. Broken bank signs, smashed windows and banged up ATM machines\ndecorated the main streets. And, as a side note, as I was first looking at these scenes of\nfocalized corporate property destruction and knowing the severity of our own financial crisis\nand the saddened betrayals in the American government's handling of the situation, it occurred\nto me for the first time, \"Shit, why aren't we smashing in our banks?\"\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAs the news around the globe lit up at the worst continuing violence Greece has seen in years\nI became increasingly interested in what the people in the riots must be thinking. Amy Goodman\nof Democracy now did a fabulous report on the struggle by interviewing a student activist\ninvolved. He explained the situation both culturally and historically, and he too explained\nthe fact that the Greek people are struggling financially and they want change, they want a\ncorrupt parliament to step down, they are angry at the death of this boy, they want justice\nfor this killing and he has become the symbol of a revolution encompassing the search for\nsocioeconomic justice.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAthens continued to riot daily. I planned to go into Athens on the second weekend of the\nriots. What I saw caused a mixture of emotions. When I arrived in Panepestimeo the subway stop\nwhere my friend lived, the first thing I saw was the national library. To the left of this\nbuilding is a statue of a man with one arm pointing to the left, on the chest of this figure\nwas the anarchist \"a\" symbol and the face of the statue was blackened. Further in the square\nwas an angel statue, whose face was also blackened with spray paint. As I walked the streets\nof the area where the rioting had been its fiercest the smell of burned buildings permeated\neverything. Trees, a couple of private kiosks and several corporate store front properties\nwere burned, some had already gutted their storefronts and were in the process of\nreconstruction. Many still revealed minor damage like bashed in storefront windows and ATMs.\nSpray art on the walls depicted images relating to the struggle, figures of people in gas\nmasks, riot police, and stencils of Alex's image were common. On the various trips I took in\nAthens each day there was more. More riot police images with red paint, painted images\nemulating chalk bodies on walls and streets, etc. The most powerful image other than that of\nactual riots and protesting that I saw was the National Bank of Greece that had been\nsplattered to the top with dripping red paint emulating blood and a stenciled image of Alex on\nthe pillars of the bank over it.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nOn my first weekend trip into Athens a peaceful protest had been planned as they had been\noccurring several times outside of Parliament. When I arrived I saw hordes of people on the\nstreet and in Parliament Square. The riot police had not yet come and everyone seemed rather\nmellow. People were holding signs referring to the economy, the struggle, the alliance with it\nand referencing the murder of Alex. I wanted to know what those who were protesting felt, what\nwas happening and why they were there in their own words. I decided to speak to one man who\nwas a student protester. He was eager to speak to me and we had a long conversation about what\nis really happening here. I quickly learned that this struggle, like most struggles, has\ndeeper roots than the current situation it is confronting. With emotional thoughts and\nfighting back tears that were welling in his eyes he linked it all the way back to American\nforeign policy in the 1960's, communist struggles in Greece and the visions of Karl Marx.\nThere is a severe distaste and disgust with the current corruption of the conservative\ngovernment and the lack of true representation of the people, and this situation is a\ncontinuance of the past. He explained it in ways I cannot rearticulate but when we left he\nshook my hand, hugged me tightly and looked in my eyes and said thank you, we appreciate your\nsolidarity, we need the people here with us, good luck to you with your new American\ngovernment, and stay safe. When I left him I ventured further into the crowd. In the middle I\nsaw a group of students who were demonstrating with their bodies. Several students had taken\noff their shirts and were knelt down with their heads to the ground in silence. Many people\nwere chanting \"batsi, gorounia, dolofoni\" which means \"cops, pigs, killers.\" As I was watching\nthe students demonstrate on the ground the crowd began to rush while screaming the words noted\nabove. I turned around to see that the crowd was rushing toward the riot police who were\nentering from the side. The crowd rushed them and they were forced to back up. I instantly\nrealized that the riot police in Greece are very, very different from the riot police in\nAmerica. A riot policeman in America would just as soon beat the shit out of you and haul you\noff to prison (which we have witnessed them do) than allow you to do to them what the Greeks\ndo to their riot police. The riot police that I saw worked as barriers to parliament, and the\nsquare where they were cleaning up previous riot debris. They worked to contain the protesters\nand the protesters responded by getting up in their faces, screaming, chanting and staring\nthem in the face for minutes and minutes at a time. The protesters were not shy to humiliate\nthem either, by throwing frappes (coffee drinks), milk, banana peels and paper snowballs at\nthem. What I saw were the riot police (different from regular police and the ones that shot\nAlex) standing there unflinching as people splattered foamy frappe drinks all over them. This\nportrayed a seemingly docile and soft group of authority figures. But when the sun went down\nand the protesters were still there I spoke to several other protesters who were commenting on\nthe softness of the riot police and said, \"yes well, they are soft, when the cameras are on\nthem, but when the cameras are not on them, they turn into animals, so keep the cameras on\nthem.\" They continued to explain that at a recent protest at the university two fourteen year\nold girls were beaten up by riot police and they were saved by teachers and fellow protesters\nwho rushed to their side and forced the police to stop the beating.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThat evening after the protest had died down and I had finished dinner with the girls in my\nprogram, rioters were at work again. When I stepped out of the restaurant there were crowds of\npeople running from the Exarchia district into the streets of Omonia. A few men were dragging\na large dumpster into the street in order to light it on fire. The riot police were about 50\nyards away. I realized later that this was a distraction for things happening in Exarchia\nSquare. The riot crowd continued on a march through the streets and I joined them with the\nriot police in pursuit but keeping their distance. The rioters stopped traffic in their march\ntoward Monastraki, while about four disguised members very close to where I was tried to set\nfire to different public properties in our trail. I saw a man to my left walk up to a bank\nsign and smash it in with his motorcycle helmet setting off the alarm while another boy to my\nright climbed up a structure and repeatedly smashed a surveillance camera into oblivion with a\nwooden plank. The rioters seemed safe and the violence was contained exclusively to property,\nit was not in the least directed towards each other or any other human figure.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAfter the riot I walked back to Exarchia and saw what the rioters were trying to distract. I\nfirst smelled the sour, thick odor of burning trash and plastic drifting down the alley\npermeating my clothing and hair. I saw people standing outside their storefronts looking up\nthe street while covering their faces. As I walked further I saw that burning dumpsters filled\nwith trash had blocked off the four corner entrances to Exarchia square. It was quiet and\neerie, like the calm after a storm. Riot police stood at the four corners and firemen were\nputting out the flames. Banks and storefronts had their metal barricades peeled back with\nsmashed glass beneath. Burned debris scattered the streets. Locals who were not rioters were\nyelling at the riot police in anger. As I walked further up trying to find my way back to the\napartment, for the first time I randomly came upon the site where Alex was shot. On that\nevening it was quiet and glowing with the sound of far off sirens and the hum of fire in the\ndistance."], ["The Green Room: Eyewitness account of yesterday's protests", "http://theonlygreenroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/eyewitness-account-of-yesterdays.html", "The Green Room", "http://theonlygreenroom.blogspot.com", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>From Joe Rooney, Green Party member:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nRhythm section of the revolution<br />\nSo, after the last time I did this, I thought I'd write another post about what it was like to\nbe a member of UCU staff involved in yesterday's political activity. I should say before I\nstart that I'm writing this in my personal capacity, on my personal blog, and nothing I say\nhere should in any way be taken to be necessarily reflective of any position or policy of\nUCU's. I'm also not writing this as a dig at individual Police or to condone any acts of\nviolence or vandalism (although there is a clear ethical distinction between violence against\nthe person and violence against property so far as I am concerned).<br />\n<br />\nNUS and UCU organised three events yesterday. The first was a lobby of MPs ahead of the vote.\nThe second was a rally with speeches on Victoria Embankment. The third was a \"candlelight\nvigil\" using 9,000 glowsticks to make the point that 9,000 is a big old number.<br />\n<br />\nThe day started with a briefing for stewards (including me) from the Police. We'd hired a\nprofessional stewarding firm for the rally and vigil after what happened at the first demo we\ndid, so we were only stewarding the Lobby. The guy from Westminster Palace Police told us that\nofficers had been shipped in from all over London, and that their upper estimate for number of\nstudents in attendance was 100,000 (that's one hundred thousand). I almost fell off my chair\nlaughing - moreso when he told us that he was keen to avoid running battles in Westminster\nHall. I'm not sure that was ever a risk, but fine.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, so I was stewarding outside the Houses of Parliament, right behind the police line. To\nstart with, there wasn't much there - a truck deploying sandbags onto the road, but very few\npolice - although quite a few riot vans drove past us at speed. When a colleague and I went to\nget a coffee, however, we turned the corner to see a huge number of riot vans parked up, and\nlots of burly-looking police in sky blue baseball caps* with truncheons already in hand\nwalking around in groups.<br />\n<br />\nOver the course of the next hour or so, a line of regular police just sort of materialised\nalongside us, while a small number of protesters appeared at the Whitehall police line. There\nwere walls of police everywhere I looked around midday. They brought out the horses around\n2pm, and they lined up behind rows of the blue-caps who were now in full riot gear.<br />\n<br />\nAnd then the protesters arrived - organised by God-knows-who, and certainly not the 100,000\nthe police had (massively over-)prepared for. The first thing they'd have seen is the\nthree-deep riot cops waiting for them with masks down and shields up.<br />\n<br />\nAt this point, the lobby was done - shut down by the cops, two of whom were standing on the\nramp down to the visitors' entrance with their automatic firearms in hand. Other police\nsuggested we move away for our own safety, and most of the other stewards did, our work\neffectively being done. My colleague and I elected to stay, and I spent the time taking photos\nand tweeting when something noteworthy occurred. We saw riot police dragging out broken\nfences. In fairness, protesters were using firecrackers and smokebombs (at least I assume it\nwas protesters) but no violence.<br />\n<br />\nIt wasn't long after that people started tweeting about Shiv Malik getting hit by a baton and\nhaving to go to A&amp;E. Not much after that, a student activist was pulled out of his\nwheelchair by the police. Twice.<br />\n<br />\nThe police told us the line was going to break soon, although it didn't. I did see the\nprotesters turn to leave Parliament Square, though, and later heard how the mounted Police\ncharged into the rear of the retreating students while the front encountered the kettle.<br />\n<br />\nBlissfully unaware, my colleague and I headed into Central Lobby, handed in our fetching pink\nhi-vis vests, and went to the rally. We had to go cross the river twice to avoid the police\nlines but we got there, to a pretty understated rally; the Police weren't letting anyone out\nof the kettles to let them come to the rally despite claims to the contrary. The rally itself\nwas very cool, with lots of quality speeches. The best was, of course, the Green Party's\nCaroline Lucas, able to say with confidence that we're the only Parliamentary party in England\nwith a genuine commitment to free education. She talked about Business Education Tax and Robin\nHood Tax and got a really good response. A later speaker, from the Union of Jewish Students,\nmade the very good point that Labour got us into this mess, and the Tories and Lib Dems made\nit worse - who can we trust. My personal answer is obvious, but I'm not keen to preach.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, I headed home at this point, as I was shattered. As I left, however, I read about the\nMet's claims that the kettle was over with interest - only to discover that it was apparently\na trick, as protesters trying to leave were kettled on Westminster Bridge, away from the\ntoilets the Met had \"generously\" provided, and weren't allowed to leave without submitting to\nbeing videoed. Y'know, waiving their rights - a friend of mine checked with a police station\nand was told that it was non-negotiable.<br />\n<br />\nOther highlights - protesters being told they were being kettled under first common law, then\nbreach of the peace, then common law again, then a spokesperson on News 24 claiming they\nweren't using kettling tactics..!<br />\n<br />\nPlease distribute wherever you'd like.</div>"], ["The Hamilton Adventures: G20", "http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2010/07/g20.html", "The Hamilton Adventures", "http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>Disclaimer: I didn't know how to go about doing this.\nMaybe I'm paranoid (I certainly felt paranoid on Sunday...), but I worry that posting this\nwill in someway have a negative affect on my career. I think there are many people in the\ngovernance and corporate worlds who - implicitly if not explicitly - feel that even being\nassociated with something like the violence on the weekend is subversive. But I have decided\nsomething, and I'm not trying to sound pompous even though I know that's how it will come out:\nthis is more important than my career prospects. If someone thinks I can't handle a position\nof responsibility because I support human rights, then so be it. I really don't want to live\nin a world where people feel that way, as much I know I do (and will for the rest of my\nlife).<br />\n<br />\nBefore I get to my actual experiences of last Saturday and Sunday, I think we can pinpoint a\nnumber of decisions that were made prior to the summits which helped cause this mess. Some of\nthese mistakes were foreseeable while others maybe not so much.<br />\n<br />\nThe cost could never be justified:<br />\nI sincerely doubt $500 mil would have bought half as much security. I think that any taxpayer\nshould be outraged that Canadian's forked over more than $1 Billion essentially to increase\nour international prestige and to convince the world (as we always try, and fail, to do) that\nCanada is important.<br />\n<br />\nDon't have both summits at the same time and/or in the same country:<br />\nI don't know why they held both together, but they did. It seems unnecessary, it should have\nbeen financially prohibitive, and it confuses the purposes of the two. It also further\nheightens the fear of the leaders and their need for security, me thinks.<br />\n<br />\nIf you must have both summits at the same time in the same country, don't hold them in two\nseparate places:<br />\nPutting them both in Muskoka or Toronto would have (theoretically) decreased costs (especially\nsecurity costs) a huge amount because they would have had to employ far less people for the\nwhole thing.<br />\n<br />\nDon't hold these summits in the downtowns of large population centres:<br />\nThis is obvious. It is more obvious today than it was two weeks ago, but it seemed obvious to\nme then. Before I volunteered to monitor, I was thinking \"I will stay the fuck away from\nToronto that weekend\" because I knew it could only be a mess.<br />\n<br />\nIf you must hold the summit(s) in your largest city, do not keep the police from doing their\njobs:<br />\nPart of the problem with what happened, and part of the reason Torontonians are so seemingly\nso supportive of the huge abuses committed by police is because they feel the property damage\njustifies such abuses. If TPS had been allowed to perform their regular duties, and the\nfence-defending left to the imported cops, it is likely that less of the damage would have\noccurred. TPS' mandate should be the protection of Torontonians and their property. They were\nremoved from this job for a few days and the city and its citizens suffered the consequences.\nI firmly believe that if TPS, or half of TPS, had been assigned to doing normal police work,\nthere would have been less violence.<br />\n<br />\nThe police don't need to be militarized from the outset:<br />\nI do not understand why, if there really were only 100 \"anarchists,\" the world leaders\nrequired thousands of riot cops. The assumption is that they were required. They weren't\nrequired until Saturday. We can debate about whether they were required after that. Riot cops\nshould be a last resort to mob violence, not the original plan for peaceful protests. In the\nCCLA report available on their website (ccla.org), they note that people have indeed studied\ncrowd control and found their are far more effective ways of dealing with crowds than erecting\nwalls of shields.<br />\n<br />\nI don't blame Blair for this. He was put in a difficult, perhaps no-win, situation by poor\nplanning on the parts of the federal and provincial governments and whomever else was involved\nin the organizing of the summits. I do think he shares responsibility, especially for what\nhappened on Saturday night and on Sunday, but he is far from the sole person\nresponsible.<br />\n<br />\nAfter all this, here is what I did last weekend. Yesterday means the 26th of June and today\nmeans the 27th of June:<br />\n<br />\n\"Yesterday I watched a peaceful union protest go down university from Queen's Park and turn\nonto Queen. Freedom of movement was a little restricted but there were few police at first,\nexcept around the US consulate.<br />\nOnce we got near Queen things changed. There were police everywhere, blocking each street in\ntwo rows (one of regular cops, one on Richmond of riot police). The union members were all\nvery well behaved. They were marching in their groups and listening to their marshals. The\nproblem, I guess, were the people following at the back (whom I was with, in order to see what\nhappened). At Spadina, the main protest went north, but some people tried to get to the fence\nby going south. I don't know why the police picked Richmond to stop them. They did. I watched\na standoff for probably over an hour and a half. Tear gas was threatened multiple times. I saw\npeople pushed unnecessarily. Four people were detained, although one was arrested and three\nreleased. I saw some horses charge people on Richmond. But on the whole things were fairly\ncivil. People who lived in the area weren't allowed to go home, but it definitely wasn't a\nterrible situation. For the most part, the protesters grew less and less interested and sort\nof drifted away. By the time my monitoring buddy and I left, there were maybe 1/4th the\nprotesters who had originally showed up still at the intersection. The police recognized this\nby replacing the riot cops with a bike fence (a tactic they have used a lot of times). Though\nI recognize the restriction of freedom here, the whole thing really wasn't a big deal. It\nturned out that what was happening on Queen itself was a whole other ballgame.<br />\nI never saw these \"black bloc\" folks that ran up queen beating the cars and windows, I just\nsaw the aftermath. People continued to break the cars and this one guy (who has been all over\nthe news) was using the PA system and sirens as his personal turntable. From where I stood,\nthe police could have easily come around the corner and stopped this at any time. They have\nstated their priority was otherwise. Either that was the case, and they thought these cars\nwere some kind of distraction to lure them away from their defensive positions, or the cars\nwere left there deliberately, to make some kind of scene to justify the budget. I am leaning\ntowards the former, but at the time it really did seem like the latter. I should mention that\nthis was the only place in the entire city that I thought was chaotic. At no point do I agree\nwith the media that the police \"lost control\" of Toronto. Blocks away people were acting like\nnothing was going on.<br />\n<br />\nWe roamed around downtown for a while, which was like a ghost town (but in no way dangerous).\nWe saw more riot cops chasing some protesters up York. We got there late so we don't know what\nhappened. We went along the fence and watched people get randomly searched for no reason, and\nwe watched the cops hassle every single person (with special passes to get inside) attempting\nto enter the restricted area.<br />\n<br />\nTrying to find our way to some form of transit, we headed in the direction of Spadina. We\nrealized we were near the broken police cars and, assuming they had been towed away, we went\nto see what was left of the mess. We found that the crowd had changed but the cars were still\nthere. The DJing guy was clearly drunk and/or high (he could barely walk, his pants were\nfalling down) and was lighting one on fire (by the way, never once saw him in any march\nanywhere, I think he was just a lunatic). At first the fire was under it and then it engulfed\nthe thing. The crowd was just the curious. I didn't recognize anyone from earlier. After the\ncar lit on fire three cops appeared from nowhere and arrested him. Three cops. It was at least\n1 hour and 20 minutes later. A few other cops came by to escort him away, but it just proved\nmy point that they could have stopped this earlier if they had really wanted to (whatever\ntheir reasons).<br />\n<br />\nOn the way to Bloor we asked some cops why they hadn't stopped the fire. Playing good cop bad\ncop, one told us they had didn't have enough resources (despite my hearing rumours of 20,000\npolice and private security personnel in Toronto and Huntsville) and the other ordered us to\ngo home, not knowing anything about who we were, where we lived, etc.<br />\n<br />\nThe shit hit the fan later. I don't know a whole lot. I know that two of the three night\nprotests I heard of were supposedly violent, but that the one at the detention centre (where\neveryone was supposedly eventually arrested) was peaceful. Two of our monitors were arrested\nand last I heard they still hadn't been released over 12 hours later (despite ample\ndocumentation which we carried to show our intent and purpose).<br />\n<br />\nToday was a totally different story. We went to observe a protest at the detention centre that\nwas supposedly low risk. We went because we were told that the police had, because of last\nnight, classified all protests suddenly as \"high risk.\" When we got to the organization point,\nthere were few visible police (though many more hiding in unmarked cars around the corner) and\nfew protesters. They were negotiating about where it would be. It seemed civil.<br />\n<br />\nNothing was happening to so we headed down to the detention centre. There, my partner and I\nwere detained for several minutes for writing notes. We were also mocked for our stated\npurpose, as the bad cop (in this situation again they were playing good cop bad cop) didn't\nseem to think that civil liberties were worth protecting, or that the two of us could do\nanything to protect them.<br />\n<br />\nLearning that the protest was a go and was coming down to Eastern Avenue, we ran over to the\ncross street. We observed a totally peaceful, orderly protest march up Eastern to the film\nstudio. There the police asked the protesters to move onto Pape and eventually they did so.\nEveryone was VERY respectful. The police were as polite about asking them to move as I could\nimagine and the protesters were only taking so much time to move because some of them were\nsinging and not paying attention. It seemed totally innocent. We almost left.<br />\n<br />\nA van was sitting in the middle of eastern Avenue. We thought they were locals because they\ndidn't look like cops, until we realized it had been sitting there for minutes. Then we saw a\nwalkie talkie inside.<br />\n<br />\nWithout any warning from anyone, another van pulled up behind it and seemingly ten (but it was\nall so fast I don't remember) plain clothes \"officers\" rushed the crowd through police lines.\nNone identified themselves as police. They attacked the crowd. They didn't enter it, they\nattacked it. They punched people. They used those wands that extend from a small little thing\nto a 2 foot long stick. They grabbed two people, beat them, dragged them across the pavement,\nthrough them in the vans, and took off. A couple of the plain clothes officers retreated into\nthe detention centre but before they did they threatened all of us repeatedly. These two\npeople could have probably been arrested by four riot cops, had they really been the anarchist\nringleaders they were supposed to be (it's hard to know when people estimate 200 vandals but\nthe cops have locked up 500 people, that is pretty terrible arithmetic). While and after this\nhappened the police charged the crowd and beat them back even though nobody had done anything.\nRiot cops began to show up. Two more people were arrested (one of whom was severely beaten and\nhad his head between a curb and a cop's knee) and who knows how many were beaten. The cops\ntook someone's bike. We weren't able to see the riot cops rush them so much, because the\nregular cops ordered us back around the corner. One told a member of the media, \"I don't care\nif you're media, if you come forward you will get hurt.\" We hears shots (rubber bullets?\nblanks? don't know) and a loud bang (attributed to both tear gas a smoke bomb). The riot cops\nwere being led by the very same officer who had coordinated with the protest. They told them\nit was okay, then they beat the shit out of them.<br />\n<br />\nOnce we had circled the block to come down Pape from the north to get a better view, all (or\nalmost all) the protesters were gone. But the police insisted on clearing Pape. They ordered\nthe media to back off, they searched people, they ordered people off their porches and inside\ntheir homes. They ordered a woman trying to walk her dog to get back in her house or run up\nthe street. Thre was one guy with a megaphone who I don't believe was present as the centre. I\nsaw no one else I could place from the protest. Only media and residents.<br />\n<br />\nBy the time the cops (in two rows like yesterday, regular cops followed by riot cops) made it\nup to Queen, they had created a new protest group: the residents. Residents were screaming at\nthem about not being able to access their homes, about having cops in a residential area, and\nso forth. The ages were markedly different so I really believe they were two separate groups\nof people. The police would not let anyone back on Pape, though they were letting those on\nPape to exit their houses.<br />\n<br />\nAs we walked along Queen (as the police on Queen weren't going anywhere or doing much of\nanything except blocking the street) we saw that all streets heading south were blocked, as if\nthey had created a perimeter around the detention centre.<br />\n<br />\nOn both days, nearby neighbourhoods were totally oblivious to what was happening so I really\ndon't see how anyone can claim the city was gripped by chaos, or that the police lost control\nof the city (should police be about controlling a city? it isn't a military base).<br />\n<br />\nThe actions of the cops today shocked me and alarmed me to an extent I was not expecting. I\nhave never participated in a protest. I am sure this stuff goes on much more than I know, but\nit was new to me. I think the actions of the police were totally unjustifiable. Unfortunately,\nall we have our license plates pretty much. But anyway, I am appalled. I think that this is a\nlow point, at least in my personal experience, for the respect of rights and freedoms in\nToronto. I did not feel like I was living in a free country this afternoon. As the lawyer I\nwas with said, even if those two were serial killers, they still could have arrested them\nproperly without harm to themselves. Instead they pulled some fascist bullshit.<br />\n<br />\nThis is unfortunate. Blair sounded like a reasonable man last night. What he is saying and\nwhat they are doing don't seem to gel. It's one thing to want to round up vandals, but we're\ntalking about property damage here, not murder. The use of force should be proportionate and\nso should the suspension of liberty. There was no moderation today. This whole thing has been\na travesty, from the cost to the behaviour of the police (today, if not last night...and as I\nsaid, I saw nothing horrible from the police on Saturday while I was out). The fact that the\npolice were, from the start, more concerned with the security of a few politicians rather than\nwith the citizens and property of the city of Toronto is also a major concern. It is very\nunfortunate that most people seem to think that broken windows and burnt cars should warrant\nany response the police wish.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd one more thing:<br />\n\"Our two monitors who were arrested Saturday night had everything taken away from them\nincluding their emergency contact information (we had numbers for the CCLA, numbers for our\nsupervisors, and the number of an on-call lawyer who would be ready to come try to get us out)\non a tiny laminated card. Whenever they were allowed their phone call (and this seems to have\nbeen 8-12 hours after they were arrested) they could only call their parents or friends. In\norder to prevent this happening to us we wrote the numbers on our skin, under our clothes (so\nthe cops wouldn't think it suspicious that we had info on our arms). That seems extreme.

The mainstream media is gradually catching up with what's been up on</p>\n</div>\n\nLibcom and other radical websites for days. The police violently attack the Climate Camp, the\npolice pointed Tasers at non-threatening people on the floor of the squatted convergence\ncentre, the police did lots of bad things and the IPCC is investigating.\n\n<p>However, one element I haven't yet seen in print is the question of whether the police\ndeliberately set things up to try to cause a riot. Think about it, if there had actually been\na full-on riot, the police wouldn't sound as pathetic blaming \"pushing\" by demonstrators or a\nsmall woman shouting at them as \"incitement\". Burning cars on the street, Greek-style street\nbattles with petrol bombs flying one way and tear-gas flying the other. The cops could,\nliterally, have gotten away with murder if there had actually been sustained and extreme\nviolence from demonstrators. The problem for them was - there wasn't.</p>\n\n<p>This might sound a little bit conspiratorial - OK, it sounds a lot conspiratorial, but I\nthink the police in London tried very hard to start a riot and their plans and tactics were\nbuilt around the riot that never happened. I was at the Bank on Wednesday; I arrived with a\ncolleague doing some filming with the red horseman of the apocalypse. From the beginning,\npolice tactics seemed designed to annoy and frustrate demonstrators.</p>\n\n<p><span id=\"more-62\"></span>The whole idea of G20 Meltdown was convergence of the four\nthemes, represented by the four horsemen, in the area in front of the Royal Exchange steps\nbeside Bank station. The cops, from the very start, didn't seem to want all the groups coming\ntogether and set up a very thin line on Threadneedle Street, to the side of the Exchange to\nprevent the convergence. A single line of yellow-clad cops with hundreds of demonstrators on\none side and well over a thousand on the other - tactically idiotic and potentially dangerous.\nAfter much pushing and shoving, the police decided it was strategic to withdraw; scrambling\nrather ridiculously up a side wall.</p>\n\n<p>Convergence achieved, the mood lightened, annoyance receded and a party atmosphere started\nto take hold - for a while. Police lines started to appear around the edges - shutting down\nthe side streets. After a while, the most clearly anarchist contingent (black-clad with quite\na few masks along with the four horsemen) decided to move towards the apparently unprotected\nand strangely not boarded windows of the Royal Bank of Scotland down Threadneedle Street.</p>\n\n<p>This time, the police line was somewhat more substantial - at least three deep, though,\nsituated as it was further down Threadneedle Street, there was no convenient low wall to the\nside. This line seemed determined to stay, even as a large part of the demonstration started\nto pile onto the street behind between the anarchist front-line. Within a short time, the\npolice were trying to hold the line against at least a thousand people and the pushing started\nagain. Then demonstrators started to fill in on the other side of the police lines, leaving\nthe police once again trapped between pushing protesters on either side determined to break\ntheir line.</p>\n\n<p>Then violence broke out. From my vantage point, I couldn't see who hit who first, but it\nwas clear that some of the demonstrators had turned banner poles into weapons and were\nstriking into the police lines, while the police had pulled out their telescopic batons. The\nsituation deteriorated as the entire police line, including their medics, started to lash out\nwith batons and solid truncheons, while plastic bottles, cans, flour and at least one smoke\nbomb rained down on them. At least one policeman's helmet was removed and thrown back into the\ncrowd. The temperature was rising and rising as blood started to flow.</p>\n\n<p>And then the police withdrew to the side and hundreds of demonstrators, accompanied by a\nvery large number of camera carrying media, flowed down the road to the RBS. This was where it\ngot very strange - despite the police lines visible beyond the RBS, there were only a few\nofficers at the bank's doors and nothing beside the windows. The protester then found that\npolice were lined up at the end of the road on the other side of the RBS. In effect, very\nsolid police lines were lined up to contain the now angry protest beside the RBS windows.</p>\n\nSurrounded by cameras eager for some action shots, a handful of demonstrators started to smash\nthe windows\n\n. No police response. Some people climbed in the windows and started throwing computers and\noffice equipment out and setting a few fires. The police response came slowly. Then the riot\npolice moved in and cleared the bank and gradually pushed the demonstrators back up\nThreadneedle Street.\n\n<p>Before that happened, my colleague and I decided to move back a bit and see if we could get\naround the back of the police lines. No go, the police wouldn't let anyone in around the back\nof the riot police lines - citing the fact that there had been a disturbance of the peace.\nPress cards meant nothing, the only part of the now obvious \"kettle\" around the whole of the\narea that allowed journalists through was at the end furthest away from the action at the RBS.\nOnce outside, no-one was allowed back in at any point, not demonstrators or journalists.</p>\n\n<p>What this meant in practice was that, other than the important media people who had sorted\nout vantage points over the crowd, the only people who could record the riot police push were\nthose in its path, mostly trying to get out of the way. No journalist was allowed to take up\nsafe position behind it.</p>\n\n<p>In effect, the police gave carte blanche to angry protestors to attack the RBS in front of\nthe media's cameras creating the violence necessary to unleash the riot police, complete with\nhorses and dogs. Why didn't the riot police just set themselves up in front of the bank to\nprotect the windows and make it clear that this line wasn't going to break?</p>\n\n<p>The police restricted the ability of the press to cover their response, a tactic that\ncontinued for the rest of the day as this response became more and more extreme. They\nresponded to a riot that never happened. After the RBS windows were broken, the whole thing\nchilled out again. Music played, people danced and the police over-reacted. At one point,\nhaving accidentally managed to get back inside the kettle (a police line disintegrated in\nfront of us as a new one formed behind us), my colleague and I were standing in front of a\nriot police line on Threadneedle Street.</p>\n\n<p>After a bit of filming of the solid police line, complete with horses, we started talking\nto some people beside us. We were clearly media. On the ground beside us were some young\npeople lying down and enjoying the sun. Further across, there was a group of young Italian\nanarchists, one of whom was dancing in front of the police. In other words, it was a chilled\nout, unthreatening and definitely non-violent group of people. So we were shocked when we\nheard the yell \"RUN\" as the police lines started to push forward with absolutely no warning.\nIt was hard to tell in the craziness if the kids on the ground had managed to get up in time.\nCompletely unprovoked and unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>It could have been very different. The police could have defended the Bank; in fact,\nsomeone with some foresight could have boarded up the windows like so many other businesses in\nthe area. The police could legitimately have restrained the demonstration to a specific area\nand allowed the peaceful carnival atmosphere to rule the day. They could have let people go\nhome when they wanted; they could have fulfilled their official function to maintain peace and\norder. Instead, they tried and failed to incite a riot and acted as if they had.</p>\n\n<h3>3 Responses to \"Did the cops try to cause a riot at G20?\"</h3>\n\n<p>Kettling tactics provoke rather than contain violence. If there is no line of riot police\nto confront the crowd will not get angry. Yes you may end up with some traffic disruption and\nmaybe one or two broken windows but isn't a bit of minor disruption a price worth paying for a\nfunctioning democracy and a less serious crime than violence against the person. The police\nseem to disagree.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a light hearted way of getting the message across to the Metropolitan police\nthat it is not acceptable to hold peaceful protesters in this way - just send them your old\nkettle!</p>\n\n<p>\"<br />\nDisposing of your old kettle in an environmentally friendly way is difficult.

I witnessed similar tactics by the police, a few moons ago on the\nPoll Tax demo.</p>\n\n<p>The Poll Tax march was notable because of the large number of first time\nprotestors/marchers; many old ladies and young families with children, who had never done this\nsort of thing before, were on this march.</p>\n\n<p>We were all peacefully progressing up Whitehall from Parliament Square when suddenly the\npolice threw two cordons across the marchers, one at the Parliament Square end and the other\nhalf way up Whitehall. Those of us caught up between these two police lines were instructed by\nthe police to leave. While the crowd around us dispersed, I and fellow BECTU marchers stayed\non to see what they were up to (Tony Lennon had his binoculars with him.) Once most marchers\nfrom the cordoned off section had gone, a line of mounted police suddenly appeared from the\nDowning Street/Horse Guards side of Whitehall and rode across the bottom end of the police\ncordon. The marchers beyond this line, moving towards Trafalgar Square were totally orderly\nand peaceful, but despite this the police began driving their horses into the crowd. It was\nparticularly appalling because we could see (through Tony's binoculars) that there were small\nchildren and toddlers in push-chairs directly in the path of the police horses. Naturally the\nmarchers then started to try to defend themselves from this totally unprovoked onslaught and\nbegan hurling placards and the sticks from placards back at the mounted police in\nresponse.</p>\n\n<p>It was subsequently reported that the demonstrators had started the trouble.</p>\n\n<p>On retreating up the side roads up towards Charing Cross and Trafalgar Square, I witnessed\nyet further police provocation. I saw police vans being driven up the side roads at alarming\nspeed, towards and into the crowds in Trafalgar Square.</p>\n\nsunny_hundal Anti-Britishness is kind of part of American history, isn't it?

As we\napproached Parliament there was a heavy riot cop presence. From Horse Guards Rd walking up\nGreat George Street towards Parliament (the sky was turning pink from the smoke bombs) we\nended up being kinda caged in Parliament Square.\n\n<p>There was a raised concrete and grass section which had been cordoned off but it had been\nkicked in, I stood on that section as it had a good vantage point (and also I had lost Simon\nand Carl by that point?) there were riot cops on horseback on the grass bit, one horse started\nto rear up which made people flee. I certainly felt scared, and trapped .</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, I got out and wandered down towards St James Park. Got back in touch with\nCarl, we wandered back up Great George Street where we watched more mounted cops (saw about 20\nmaybe more) turning off into the side streets. There was a massive police presence on Great\nGeorge Street where we were allowed to walk through. Again, we wandered around, watching then\nrunning ourselves as one of the blocked off points was being attacked by riot cops on\nhorseback (around Westminster Abbey/Victoria Street).</p>\n\n<p>It then became apparent that the line we were freely able to walk in and out of Parliament\nSquare was being blocked off. More reinforcements appeared, some in full riot gear, visors up\nand shields at a ready. We asked whether we could get out, no was the answer as it was going\nto be \"blocked off all evening\"(??). We were then told to go towards Whitehall but then when\nwe got there?.. it was blocked!</p>\n\n<p>The cops were telling people rubbish. We walked back towards Great George Street where we\nsaw a a group of people rushing towards the line carrying a man who was hurt, the cops let\nthem through the line but the guy looked bad.</p>\n\n<p>Protesters were running around, frustrated and angry trying to find a way out. Fires were\nbeing lit to keep warm. I saw Jon Cruddas who let me take his picture. A Lib-Dem MP walking\nthrough Parliament where people shouted, \"Shame on you\"! His face looked wet not sure if he\nwas crying or whether someone spat at him.</p>\n\n<p>We heard as well from one steward that he heard that the cops were bringing in more\nreinforcements. By this as well people had been kettled for a couple of hours which meant\npeople were pissing against walls, a couple of women had hidden themselves behind their\nbanners against a window ledge. I guess they were desperate for a piss too. And that's one of\nthe hideous thing about kettling is that it reduces people to nothing. When one protester\nasked the riot cop whether we were being kettled, the cops replied, \"no you are being\ncontained\"?.</p>\n\n<p>Contained. Kettled. It's the same bloody thing. I saw an elderly woman around 70 maybe\nolder not being allowed out of the kettle, she wasn't part of the demo, she looked confused.\nIt was disgusting watching this.

I went to the protest against police brutality, I went with Ice Cream,\nAustralia, TKJ, Guts and Dreads was there as a photographer (not that it mattered later on).\nThe protest was great and of course deteriorated into a proto-riot at the end. It started out\npretty calm, an anarchist marching band playing music, people standing around and a punk\nthrowing some muffins at cops. After we started marching towards the downtown (we never got\nout the suburbs since we were far and the cops...) a black bloc started to take action.<br />\nThese guys were prepared and had brought along all kinds of goodies for the police and of\ncourse were decked out in head to toe in black. They started by shooting off some fire works\nat the riot cops who lined up on the sides of the streets we were marching down, it was really\nspectacular seeing the fireworks blow up against the police shields. They had some flares to\nthrow around also. After their assault they broke up and slipped into the crowd. And for a\nwhile we kept marching just fine, As we turned a corner and started up through a playground\nsome black bloc kids were kicking out bricks from the foot paths, but once we reached the\nmiddle of the playground people at the front of the march were telling us to change route and\nbe careful because the police had cut off the initial route in their first attempt to break up\nthe protest. As people gathered and looked for a new path we realized that another route was\nalso blocked. As everyone walked into the last remaining street the black bloc kids were\nhurling bricks and fireworks at the cops to the cheers of everyone present. At this point I\nwas with only TKJ and Australia since we had lost everyone else in the chaos. As we stood in\nthe only clear street left we realized that we had been trapped, at the top of the street was\na line of riot cops complete with shields and batons! We weren't immediately concerned until\nthey began charging down the street beating everyone they could reach while shouting \"BOUGE!\"\n(French for move). At that point we had already decided we want to get outta the protest since\nI had an exam to write that I was already late to and Australia wasn't feeling it. We were\nwalking into an alley when one of the riot cops ran past us shouting and or course hitting us\nwith their batons (don't worry riot cop batons are padded), we dashed in to more dealings with\nthe cops. I climbed a wall along with some others and crossed a yard into another street\nbehind a police wall. I looked around having lost track of TKJ and Australia so I called TKJ,\nwent back to the alley, helped a few people up the wall and we all continued to follow what\nwas left of the crowd.<br />\nThe remaining crowd was only a fraction of its former mass. We walked a few blocks, before\nhaving some routes cut off by police again, this time mail boxes and trash cans were upturned\nand some kids who remained from the black bloc turned over a cart full of woods and set it on\nfire, we looked around and saw that police were giving chase so we dashed down another alley\nway. TKJ traded phone numbers with a friend until police turned the corner and we vanished\ninto another alley.<br />\nAt this point we were set on just leaving (going back to the metro station where everyone\nlocked up their bikes). We passed a gas station were we saw something strange, a group of\nprotesters seemed to be hanging out with the cops right next to their cars; we were confused\nuntil we realized they were undercover instigators, they were there to cause enough trouble to\n\"justify\" police brutality, *sigh* bastards.<br />\nWe got the metro without mush trouble after that and I was able to take my exam (I think I did\nokay).<br />\nLater that night I went to hang with Guts, TKJ, Dreads and Australia. We just kicked it,\ntalked about the protest and went dumpstering, we found a shit ton of stuff but I only brought\nback a bit since the fridge is pretty full at the moment, can't wait to move, I'll be living\nwith 4 or 5 people and will have two fridges!</div>"], ["Ovularity: G8-G20 Protests - Saturday, Part 3", "http://ovularity.blogspot.com/2010/07/g8-g20-protests-saturday-part-3.html", "Ovularity", "http://ovularity.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We walked up University Ave. towards to see what lay in store for us.\nAnother line of cops? Most likely. We'd heard that things had gotten harrier down there, but\ngiven the well-maintained lines of riot police I'd seen earlier today, I didn't expect\nanything too hairy. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"></span>On our way North we saw a topless\nwoman with a microphone, reporting in front of the barricade around the American consulate.\nThe police didn't seem to mind. Maybe a few of them were fans of the naked news\nthemselves.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As we approached the corner of College and University the inevitable line\nof police came into view. All of 10 metres away stood our bikes, now unreachable. I went up to\nthe friendliest cop I could find and asked him if we could get through to grab our ride home.\nHe said \"no\" with a smile. I asked him when the cordoned-off area might become accessible. He\nlaughed: \"Come back in a couple of days.\"</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We went south and ducked west, hoping that maybe westerly police line\nblocking College St would be behind our bikes. My friend knocked my hat off my head in\nfrustration. \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\" I explained. \"The more I think about\nit, it's actually a <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">horrible</i> idea! Why on Earth\nwould we lock our bikes next to the designated protest zone?\" He was right - looking back, it\n<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">was</i> a horrible idea. Though annoyed, I found\neverything more funny than tragic - after all, as long as our bikes were in one piece it\nwouldn't be the end of the world; home is, after all, only 30 minute walk away.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Coming East on College St, up to the westerly line, we finally saw our\nbikes. Unfortunately we also saw a riot police less than 10 metres in front of them. We\nlamented the situation aloud. My friend made a video of the whole event. I briefly considered\nasking the riot cops, but as I'd learned earlier that day, given the right circumstances and\nthe right officer, you might be able to hold a conversation with a regular cop, but never with\n21<sup>st</sup> century legionnaire. Put a cop in riot gear and they seem to lose their\nhumanity, their ability for independent thought. To call them \"riot police\" is something of a\nmisnomer - they're infantry, armed, armored, and distinctly disinclined to verbally engage The\nEnemy.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I'm not sure what the protesters who had gathered by the Western line\nwanted. Clearly something was happening in Queen's Park - there was a bunch of police there\nand reinforcements, including cavalry, were trickling in. The protesters we saw were only a\nfew dozen-strong. Mostly they just appeared to be telling the police that they should be\nashamed of themselves, though for what, precisely, I'm not sure. Did they know something we\ndidn't? What had these guys done that was so bad, aside from block protesters from going to a\nparticular part of town? I assumed they were supposed to feel a general guilt for being The\nMan, for working against The People. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes\"></span>The crowd (or more\nspecifically a small subset of the crowd) sang \"What the world needs now is love, sweet, love.\nNo, not just for some, but for everyone.\" True that.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The riot police were relieved of their duties by some regularly-dressed\ncops. Did someone decide that this crowd wasn't a security threat (which it obviously wasn't)?\nAs they marched north I surmised that they were probably needed elsewhere. Holding the Western\nline was probably a waste of armor.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the situation improved, I decided to try my luck again. I told one\nof the cops where our bikes were and offered to give him the keys to unlock it. He said \"give\nme a few minutes and we'll see\". A minute later he took our keys and headed over to our bikes.\nOne of the protesters, the most vocal one so far, screamed \"Hands off our bikes!\" We yelled\nback \"No! They're helping us get our bikes!\" The protester was caught off guard \"Oh??? in that\ncase can you get her's?\" she asked, pointing to her friend. It looked like the cop was going\nto say yes. Good man.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We thanked our one-man bike-retrieval-unit and rode home. Our G20\nexperience, at least the \"run around and see what's going on\" portion of it, was over. We'd\nseen a lot of anger and volume, but few physical confrontations. We'd seen some wanton\ndestruction, but not too much, all things considered. From our perspective the police seemed\nto be on their best behaviour - I can imagine how pissed off I'd be, standing around in riot\ngear, having people yell at me for no conceivable reason, rage at my sheer presence. I rode\nhome feeling a sense of satisfaction - while freedom of movement was moderately disrupted,\nfree speech remained intact.

Today the Skytrain was closed for\nhalf the day and many shops and malls in the central part of the city didn't even bother to\nopen. Pro-democracy demonstrators continue to occupy major intersections in the city,\nincluding the intersections around Siam Square, Central World and Chitlom.<br />\n<br />\nThe Phan Fa Bridge area, just adjacent to the Golden Mount, was the scene of some violent\nclashes between the military and protesters today and there have been dozens of injuries\nreported.<br />\n<br />\nI would strongly advise avoiding any areas where protesters and police or army could possibly\nclash. I spent some time at one of the big protest areas this afternoon and it was tense.\nProtesters faced off against riot police for hours and though the riot police were friendly\nand relaxed, and the protesters did not want to escalate things, a situation like that could\nhave easily led to violence. At one point during the afternoon, the few hundred riot police\nwere surrounded by thousands of protesters, with more pouring in. I saw a few tourists\nrandomly walking by to check things out and had to really wonder about their judgment. If you\ncan't speak the language and don't know the area well, what would you do if troops started\nfiring tear gas or rubber bullets? Or if thousands of people started stampeding? How could you\neven see it coming? Any of those scenarios seemed possible today and I could see how a\nbystander could have easily gotten caught up.<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OgMi4paRIiY/S8DStpyJ3bI/AAAAAAAAEWQ/3Zyzjb7780I/s1600/protest2.jpg\">\n<img style=\"MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; WIDTH: 400px; FLOAT: left; HEIGHT: 267px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5458594430125202866\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OgMi4paRIiY/S8DStpyJ3bI/AAAAAAAAEWQ/3Zyzjb7780I/s400/protest2.jpg\" /></a></div>"], ["The P/Oed Patriot: Riot Police called on Peaceful Tea Party Protesters in Quincy IL.", "http://poedpatriot.blogspot.com/2010/04/riot-police-called-on-peaceful-tea.html", "The P/Oed Patriot", "http://poedpatriot.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5zLaikgpKYI/S9jnZfKyd-I/AAAAAAAABz4/hvCEQ4sckvs/s1600/patriot+Stand+Alone.jpg\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 259px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5465372572863592418\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5zLaikgpKYI/S9jnZfKyd-I/AAAAAAAABz4/hvCEQ4sckvs/s400/patriot+Stand+Alone.jpg\" /></a><br />\n<div><br />\nToday, in Quincy Illinois outside the civic center where President Barack Obama's was giving\nspeech, 200 peaceful Tea Party Protesters were subject to intimidation by the Riot\nPolice.</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>The incident took place immediately after the President arrived at the civic center while\nthe Protesters where returning to the opposite side of the street.</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>To the surprise of all attending, a platoon of Riot Police appeared and placed themselves\nbetween the Tea Party Protesters and the civic center.</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>After the Protesters Peacefully returned to their original side of the street, they were\ntold by the Secret Service, and the Riot Police, to squeeze into an even tighter area behind\nthe sidewalk and into a parking lot.<br />\n.</div>\n<div>After several rounds of Patriotic Songs were sung by the Tea Party members, the Riot\nPolice lined up and marched off to a round of....</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>Glory, Glory Hallelujah....</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>How appropriate...</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>.</div>\n<div>Here is the Video I took at the event.</div>\n<div>.<br />\n<br />\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\"\nvalue=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ssLlyFaM3QM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f\" />\n<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<br />\n<embed\nsrc=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ssLlyFaM3QM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xcc2550&amp;color2=0xe87a9f\"\ntype=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\nwidth=\"425\" height=\"344\" /></object></div>\n<div>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class='post-footer'>\n<div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Posted by\n<span class='fn'>Mr Patch W.

I'll start with the less interesting stuff. Our basketball team lost our\nsecond game dropping us to 0-2...yikes. We got down early by about 15 points and it wasn't\nlooking good. I would bet the other team shot literally 80% including three pointers...they\njust wouldn't miss, they were a good team. We fought back and were actually up 2 points with\nabout 2 minutes left, but fell apart again and lost. I played the first half, but got very\ntired and started playing badly so coach pulled me out of the game. I need to work on my\nconditioning, but the air here is really bad and doesn't help at all. It was a heart breaker.\nAs for my other team, the Winnipeg Weons, we lost our first game on Saturday night leaving us\nwith a solid 3-1 record. Basketball has been fun and I look forward to every practice and\ngame. We also got really cool warm-up gear and jerseys...its legit.<br />\n<br />\nIn other news...there was a riot at my University on Wednesday...crazy stuff. I will start by\nsaying I didn't have my camera during my riot so I have no pictures of the absolute chaos but\nI will try my best to explain it. Two of the pictures I've included I got off the internet\n(the picture of a different riot at my school in 2008 and the picture of the two Chilean riot\ntrucks), the other two I took about two hours after the riot with the lingering effects of the\ntear gas and the patrolling riot trucks, but it is nothing compared to the actual\nexperience.<br />\n<br />\nWell I wasn't supposed to be at the university in the first place Wednesday morning, but my\nChilean friend Cecy asked if I would come to her English presentation that morning. I went to\nher presentation, everyone did really well, and we hung out at the University's patio for a\nlittle. I got a little hungry around 11am, so I said goodbye to Cecy and went out onto the\nstreet to walk home. The entrance to the University is on a side street, about 30 meters from\nthe main street of Santiago (Alameda). I stepped outside, glanced over to the right (Alameda)\nand saw a group of about 40 students standing in the street. They were jumping and whistling\nand yelling various things, so I wanted to check it out.<br />\n<br />\nI walked over, and it turned out it was a protest. I found a few of my friends from the U in\nthe crowd and asked them what we were protesting but they didn't know. Oh well, the energy was\nreally fun so I hung out in the crowd. They were blocking the main street of Santiago, and men\nwere leaning out their car window yelling stuff at the students, but the students stood firm\nin the street. No sign of cops, so the yelling and whistling and jumping continued\nnon-violently. I was in the middle of the street enjoying the aura of the protest around me.\nIt was full of energy, but peaceful....until BOOM!<br />\n<br />\nThe cops threw/launched a tear gas grenade into the group of students about 2 meters away from\nme. It was loud, and there was a little panic in the crowd as the students started\nrunning/tripping/climbing over each other to get back to our side street away from the burning\ngas. I had a little smirk on my face as I was pushing, being pushed, and running away from the\nbomb. It was a unique experience. Everyone settled down onto the sidewalks of our side street\nand the road was cleared (except for lingering tear gas). People were rubbing their eyes,\nsneezing, and crying from the gas, but we were out of immediate harms way safe on the\nsidewalks in front of our school.<br />\n<br />\nA few brave students were trying to make their way back to the main street. But then a huge\nriot police truck peeked around the corner on the main street and started shooting its water\ncannon to keep us back. I have a picture of the big green truck with the water cannon. It\nparked in front of our side street, cannon blasting, keeping everyone at a distance from\nAlameda. I was out of reach from the water, so I stood on the sidewalk catching my breath. At\nthis point there were about 100-150 students total. We were quieted from the tear gas, people\nhunched over spitting, sniffling and crying trying to regain their senses, but it wasn't over\nyet.<br />\n<br />\nAnother smaller truck appeared (also in one of the pictures provided). It came screaming down\nour street, with tear gas cannons on full blast shooting each sidewalk. I saw it coming about\n50 meters away, but there was no running from it. People were panicking at this point, trying\nto pry their way into the university to escape the searing gas. The truck got to me, and the\ngas filled my lungs, I took a few quick steps to the right, turned around, went to the left\nfor a little, then my instincts took over telling me how to escape from this horrible thing\nhappening to my body!<br />\n<br />\nI found an entrance into the University, crowded with everyone else trying to escape the\nfumes. I went deep into the University, and found Cecy doing the same thing. We hung out in\nthe \"bunker\" for a while, the gas had poured into the school (but not as strong as outside),\nand everyone was in bad shape. Girls were sobbing, eyes were swollen, and the protesters were\ngetting riled up.<br />\n<br />\nI waited about 15 minutes in the University, and decided I had my fair share of chemical\nwarfare, so I made for the exit to try and walk home. I went outside, but at this point it was\njust me and about 40 of our bravest protesters out on the street. I glanced over to the right\n(Alameda) and now they had a line of about 10 Carabineros (cops) on horseback guarding the\nmain road. The big riot truck was out of sight. The a few rebels used this to their advantage,\nand a few started hurling rocks in the direction of the cops on horseback. Uh oh.<br />\n<br />\nMore tear gas bombs started exploding from the direction of the horseback riders, and everyone\nstarted running in the opposite direction. Out of the frying pan into the fire. The big riot\ntruck had flanked us! It was approaching from behind, with about 15 cops marching on foot (gas\nmasks on) beside it. The big riot truck turned on its tear gas cannon (this thing could launch\nlike 30 meters) and we were in a cloud of tear gas, sandwiched by cops in both\ndirections.<br />\n<br />\nSince there were only about 40 students, I knew I was going to get arrested. They started\nscreaming \"HANDS UP HANDS UP\" to all the students. We were crammed together in a group,\npushing, stepping on each other, scrambling for clean air that didn't exist. I had my hands\nstraight up, trying to find an escape rout...but this was the first time in the event that I\nwas truly scared. I thought they were going to start shooting bean bag guns, or at least\narrest all of us.<br />\n<br />\nAdrenaline took over, and I spotted a brave old man across the street standing in the midst of\nthe tear gas. He had opened a gate for the students and was waving us over. I made a break for\nit across the open street. I had my hands straight up the whole time, running like an\nOrangutan for the cracked gate, chin tucked into my chest ready to take a bean bag from the\npolice at any second. Everyone followed doing the same thing, and the police were hot on our\ntail.<br />\n<br />\nEveryone poured into the gate like a bunch of 12 year old girls getting into a Jonas Brothers\nconcert. The police were trying to do the same thing, so we had to close the gate before\neveryone was in. I made a break for the farthest corner I could find of the complex to get\naway from the gas. We closed the gate, and some unlucky students didn't make it in. I heard at\nleast 6 were arrested and got taken into the station.<br />\n<br />\nI will give props to the students, and that old man, because they were very brave and blunt\nwith the police. Standing proud in the tear gas screaming curse words with their scratchy\nthroats at the police from the locked gate, telling them they can't enter. And if they tried,\nthe students would be ready. They had stockpiled desks and chairs in the hallway as ammunition\nif the police tried to get in.<br />\n<br />\nKids were hunched over in the back patio of this refuge. Spitting, coughing, sneezing,\nmuttering curse words under their breath, and things quickly settled down in the streets.\nAfter about 15 minutes, I decided (for the 2nd time) that I was finally done with the tear\ngas, and I went back to the gate. The old man was standing proud guarding it, and the rebels\nwere standing guard ready to launch some classroom equipment at the police. I peeked my face\nout through the gate (tear gas still very present) and decided I could make a break for my\nhouse. I told the man I was ready to leave, and he cracked the gate open so I could slip out.\nI ran like Forrest Gump until I was clear of the warzone.

I was in the march\nwith 10 000 people (conservative estimate) yesterday with my best friend Mercy. The day was\none of the most complex and inspiring experiences I've ever had. We walked all through\ndowntown from Queen's Park and back. So many vital causes like maternal health rights,\ngenocide in Ethiopia, climate justice, gay rights, the United Steelworkers, and people just\nchanting for democracy. Many important issues that very few are seeing on the news because the\nmedia is obsessed with the relatively few anarchists. <div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\nHey, CTV, Global, CBC: Instead of looping the same 20 second footage of the same guy smashing\na window, why don't you cut-in the 8 women leading our march with a GIANT coat hanger in\nsupport of safe, legal abortion for mothers everywhere?<br />\n<br />\nThere was a point, early on in the march, about 2 hours before the anarchists, that Mercy and\nI were suddenly across a barricade with the riot police. They just started swarming out of a\ncrack between two buildings when we were going down University Ave, banging their sticks on\ntheir shields. The noise was distracting and chilling. We couldn't understand why they were\nthere because no violence had broken out. Quickly they descended, straight for us at the\nbarricade and us protesters all standing there, \"What?\" The riot police stared us down holding\ntheir rubber bullet guns not-so-casually at their sides, but ready in their hands.<br />\n<br />\nI am still mentally and emotionally trying to unpack this chapter of our march. This close\nencounter is one of the ugliest scenes I have ever opened my eyes to that made me\nuncomfortable, feel persecuted and feel a level of threat that is unknown to me as a Canadian.\nUgly and uncomfortable like how earlier in the morning, I had pulled a fresh dead cat off my\nstreet after watching buses and cars run over her tiny mangled head again and again. I mourn\nthe cat and I mourn the perverse use of \"Serve and protect.\"<br />\n<br />\nLater, I found out that the riot police emerged at this point on University because we were\npassing the American embassy. The performance they put on for us was an act of intimidation.\nWas I scared? Yes. My hands shook and my brain was fiercely trying to make sense of these\nimages. Did I turn and run? No. Did it cross my mind? Yes. I had plenty of room to do so. I\nlooked behind for exit strategies. I could not trust these forces and what they might to do\nme.<br />\n<br />\nBut fear is transparent and together with my fellow citizens supporting me, we saw right\nthrough it. We took pictures. We shot video. We shouted \"shame\" and booed them. Don't you want\nour $1.2B worth? We reacted; that was the goal of the expense. But us 10 000 didn't react\nenough when we did what truly came downtown to do: march.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><object width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"BLOG_video_class\"\nid=\"BLOG_video-e0b8b66cfe9bd416\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"\ncodebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/get_player\" />\n<param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"flashvars\"\nvalue=\"flvurl=http%3A%2F%2Fv13.nonxt4.googlevideo.com%2Fvideoplayback%3Fid%3De0b8b66cfe9bd416%26itag%3D5%26app%3Dblogger%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1280045134%26sparams%3Did%252Citag%252Cip%252Cipbits%252Cexpire%26signature%3D6B09D9548ED1DF2B2C855D5323720F02D66E6407.1E3C454769BBB137D06A57073A79CA9521A00206%26key%3Dck1&amp;iurl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.google.com%2FThumbnailServer2%3Fapp%3Dblogger%26contentid%3De0b8b66cfe9bd416%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw320%26sigh%3DAqkJRkZ2sLibqeE-aWHE_Z7bqng&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger\" />\n<embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/get_player\" width=\"320\" height=\"266\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"\nflashvars=\"flvurl=http%3A%2F%2Fv13.nonxt4.googlevideo.com%2Fvideoplayback%3Fid%3De0b8b66cfe9bd416%26itag%3D5%26app%3Dblogger%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1280045134%26sparams%3Did%252Citag%252Cip%252Cipbits%252Cexpire%26signature%3D6B09D9548ED1DF2B2C855D5323720F02D66E6407.1E3C454769BBB137D06A57073A79CA9521A00206%26key%3Dck1&amp;iurl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.google.com%2FThumbnailServer2%3Fapp%3Dblogger%26contentid%3De0b8b66cfe9bd416%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw320%26sigh%3DAqkJRkZ2sLibqeE-aWHE_Z7bqng&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger\"\nallowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object> <a\nhref=\"rtsp://v8.cache2.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQkW1Jv-bLa44BMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp\"\ntype=\"video/3gpp\"><img width=\"320\" height=\"266\" alt=\"video\"\nsrc=\"http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app=blogger&amp;contentid=e0b8b66cfe9bd416&amp;offsetms=5000&amp;itag=w320&amp;sigh=AqkJRkZ2sLibqeE-aWHE_Z7bqng\"\nclass=\"BLOG_mobile_video_class\" id=\"BLOG_mobile_video-e0b8b66cfe9bd416\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nI heard someone around us feebly say, \"Don't boo them, they're just doing their jobs.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Yeah,\" I muttered. \"That's what the Nazi SS said too.\"<br />\n<br />\nEven from six or seven feet away, you can't see much of someone's face under those riot\nhelmets.

We were uninvited to those 6 technically public, non-security zone blocks. Tens\nof more riot police standing down behind the bikes were already in formation in these public\nareas.<br />\n<br />\nI thought of my friend Steve, up in his condo which was between the riot cops and the bike\npolice. His condo I so safely walked home from three nights before, without a care. Am I the\nhigh-risk danger now?<br />\n<br />\nAssessing danger occurred on the spot within a spectrum. There are circumstances of high -risk\nand low risk. I assessed in the crowd of union workers, teachers, immigrants and human rights\nactivists on the streets of Toronto as low-risk. When I stood gaping at a 3-deep line of riot\npolice down the road I definitely felt high-risk. And when I once turned around to find myself\nin a swarm of people wearing black clothes and balaclavas, I chose to move away.<br />\n<br />\nThe march turned onto Queen St and all along the south side at streets like Simcoe, John and\nPeter, the same scene: bike forces with lines of riot police at their backs, shields up and\nsticks ready. But we just kept marching by. The view quickly grew less sensational and more\nludicrous. Mercy and I focused our attention to the people with whom we were standing in\nsolidarity, shoulder to shoulder.<br />\n<br />\nAs independents, Mercy and I walked through the march with different groups. We walked at the\nfront of the march, the middle and the back end. Top points for chants and cheers goes to the\nUnited Steelworkers.

So that\neveryone and anyone knows that when it comes down to the two sides of the fence, regular ol'\npeople like me stood firmly with our principles, community, ethics, and humanity. For four\nhours, we walked, sang, chanted and represented together and we did this safely.<br />\n<br />\nAt last we made our victory circle back to Queen's Park and celebrated with more music and\nnon-violent chit-chatting with kids and even a few of our pets. People posted their signs and\nsnapped more photos, documenting their own experiences.<br />\n<br />\nMercy and I had left the downtown core some time before the violence happened. We got back to\nher place and saw the news coverage. We sat back, exhausted and hungry and watched how our\nfour hours of protest was getting nothing more than a brief mention as \"The peaceful protest\"\nwhile images of frantic youth in balaclavas were looped on screen. No reports highlighted the\nissues we walked for. No one broadcast the hundreds of women who lead the march.<br />\n<br />\nWe thought how if we just hadn't been there, we too would believe the media that only chaos\nreigned in Toronto on June 26, 2010. We too would believe that these anarchists were\neverywhere and must have been at it for hours upon hours. We too would get a very skewed,\nunbalanced message that could potentially lead us to think that $1B was well-spent and\nnecessary.<br />\n<br />\nBut we just changed channels. We were there and know the violent protesters were the minority.\nThat's why I'm sharing here. This message is coming from the silent majority.<br />\n<br />\nI am a fraction of a large, collective voice that was systematically omitted.<br />\n<br />\nI am one protester from the street sharing how the marching ground is a vibrant, complex,\nmultifaceted place that the mainstream media chooses not to present accurately.<br />\n<br />\nI am one taxpaying citizen who knows that our $1B on security measures were truly wasted and\nrioting was left to happen to justify the expense because 10 000 of us did it\npeacefully.<br />\n<br />\n(More pictures to follow.)<br />\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class='post-footer'>\n<div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-1'><span class='post-author vcard'>Posted by\n<span class='fn'>Victoria</span></span> <span class='post-timestamp'>at <a\nclass='timestamp-link'\nhref='http://signaldown.blogspot.com/2010/06/10-000-people-that-you-didnt-see.html'\nrel='bookmark' title='permanent link'><abbr class='published'\ntitle='2010-06-27T12:52:00-04:00'>12:52 PM</abbr></a></span> <span\nclass='post-icons'><span class='item-control blog-admin pid-1375308993'><a\nhref='http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=8543249365564955084&amp;postID=313118157495864048'\ntitle='Edit Post'><img alt='' class='icon-action' height='18'\nsrc='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif'\nwidth='18' /></a></span></span></div>\n<div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-2'><span class='post-labels'>Labels: <a\nhref='http://signaldown.blogspot.com/search/label/democracy' rel='tag'>democracy</a>, <a\nhref='http://signaldown.blogspot.com/search/label/G20' rel='tag'>G20</a>, <a\nhref='http://signaldown.blogspot.com/search/label/protest' rel='tag'>protest</a></span></div>\n<div class='post-footer-line post-footer-line-3'></div>\n</div>\n<div class='comments' id='comments'><a id=\"comments\" name='comments'></a> <h4>3 comments:</h4>\n<div class='pid-1375308993' id='Blog1_comments-block-wrapper'>\n<dl class='avatar-comment-indent' id='comments-block'>\n<dt class='comment-author ' id='c4499438961001651038'><a id=\"c4499438961001651038\"\nname='c4499438961001651038'></a></dt>\n<dd>\n<div class=\"avatar-image-container avatar-stock\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><a\nhref=\"http://www.blogger.com/profile/09284669991653122422\" rel=\"nofollow\"\nclass=\"avatar-hovercard\" id=\"av-0-09284669991653122422\"><img\nsrc=\"http://www.blogger.com/img/b16-rounded.gif\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"\"\ntitle=\"Norma\" /></a></span></div>\n<a href='http://www.blogger.com/profile/09284669991653122422' rel='nofollow'>Norma</a> said...\n</dd>\n<dd class='comment-body pid-777975878' id='Blog1_cmt-4499438961001651038'>\n<p>Wow.

It was because of\none of the peaceful rallies that were happening. I was intrigued so I thought I go check it\nout. There were a lot of people protesting about so many different things: Palestine, BP oil\nspill, human rights, peace, etc.<br />\n<br />\nI decided to take some pictures so I went back to my apartment to take my camera when suddenly\nmy friend invited me to see the movie Toys Story 3. He said he had an extra ticket. So I\ncanceled my plan of snapping those pictures and went to the movie instead. Hey, it was free so\nhow can I not go right? But I brought my camera with me. Maybe there will be something\ninteresting to take pictures of. Boy, was I right about that.<br />\n<br />\nToys Story 3 was awesome with the 3D effect and all. I would recommend it to anybody. After\nthat, my buddies and I went out of the theatre. To our surprise, the mall was closing and it\nwas only around 4.00pm. We were a bit startled but we weren't expecting anything serious. But\nthen, we walked to the Yonge St and Dundas St W intersection and found this:<br />\n<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\"\nstyle=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs517.ash1/30484_1213225749746_1801867079_412360_3524803_n.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\"\nsrc=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs517.ash1/30484_1213225749746_1801867079_412360_3524803_n.jpg\"\nwidth=\"400\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Adidas store on Yonge St and Dundas St\nW intersection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nWhoa, something was coming down!

As a bunch of us made our way back to the\nintersection, we were asked by another line of riot police to move back South. By now,\nhundreds (maybe around 3/400) of us were trapped in a circle of riot police. They would not\nlet us leave and started to arrest random people in the crowd. As this point, I put my camera\naway as ironically, I was concerned about my safety. To make things worst, it started to rain\nheavily, and for the next 4 hours, I was detained-with hundreds of ordinary people that were\ndoing ordinary things like shopping, walking their dogs, and riding their bikes-by the police\nwithout informing us on the situation the entire time. Half of the people (including\nreporters) were arrested without an explanation, while the other half were released after\nstanding in the cold hard rain for 4 hours.

Gradually I became\naccustom to the environment and started picking my moments. I let the crowd pass by so I could\ncome back at it from the rear. This was about the time I made it to Queen and Spadina, the\nparade having begun at Queens Park.<br />\nAs I arrived, I noticed a large group of people milling about, these were the members of the\nBlack Bloc.<br />\nI was quickly informed that my presence as a representative of the media was not appreciated,\nbut I ignored the warnings and did what I had come to Toronto to do, and cover what I\nsaw.<br />\nSuddenly a flare was lit and I knew things were about to get wild; once it had expired the\ncrowd, with a yell, began to run back East along Queen Street easily pushing past the thin\nline of police that were following the protest.<br />\nAlmost immediately as I began to move forward with the crowd, a bottle flew directly over my\nhead, splashing me with water as it spun and crashed into the street in front of me. The close\ncall shook me, but I hurried forward none the less.<br />\nAs Black Bloc protesters smashed windows and spray painted buildings, myself and other\nphotographers were harassed and pushed as we attempted to do our jobs. Quickly I realized it\nwould be a good idea to pare up, so I asked the closest fellow photojournalist if it was cool\nif I worked with him. <a href=\"http://thestar.blogs.com/photoblog/\">Steve Russell</a>, as I\nwould later know him by, agreed and effectively took me under his wing.<br />\nSteve is an amazing photographer who works for the Toronto Star, and I implore you to please\nclick on his name and check out his work.<br />\nThe two of us banded with other photographers and journalists and together worked to protect\neach others backs.<br />\nGradually, the protest wound its way to Bay and King, where two police cruisers were lit on\nfire. This is where the police, in full riot gear, finally began to block off the riot's\nadvance. To that point they had not attempted to intervene in the rioting and quell the\nviolence. Furthermore, what they did at this point was fairly minimal.<br />\nThe Black Bloc were funneled east on King, and that is where we lost them. Steve, myself and\nthe others in our group managed to make our way out of the area and I breathed a sigh of\nrelief.<br />\nFor the first time in about an hour, I felt safe. I had been running on fear and adrenaline\nsince Spadina and my head was swimming.<br />\nI thanked Steve for looking out for me and headed off to find some more action.<br />\nWhat I want to express is that I was scared the for the entire riot, but I mastered that fear\nand was still able to preform. I came to Toronto for that exact experience, and once it began,\nI knew I couldn't back down.<br />\nI've never been prouder to be a photojournalist than I was that day.</div>"], ["Crafts and Stuff: Our City Under Siege", "http://hettyscreations.blogspot.com/2010/06/our-city-under-siege.html", "Crafts and Stuff", "http://hettyscreations.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>I don't often use this blog to complain about the world\naround me. I know others do and I applaud them for their ability to speak their minds and not\nworry about what the rest of the world has to say. But the G8 and G20 Summits, which were just\nheld in our province, have kind of stirred up my thoughts and given me the desire to share my\nfeelings.<br />\n<br />\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 197px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487881832808217282\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GkLjqwzywZ0/TCjfc23aesI/AAAAAAAADw8/PeiDBmiso1Q/s320/4_World_Summit_sff_300.jpg\" />While\nthe G20 members were calmly smiling, waving and posing for the cameras, our city was anything\nbut calm. Thousands of protesters descended on downtown streets when the G20 Summit was held\nhere this past weekend. Although noisy at times, they were mainly peaceful and nonviolent -\nlots of colour, lots of signs, lots of chanting, lots of music and dancing in the streets.\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 195px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487880721100042930\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GkLjqwzywZ0/TCjecJbh8rI/AAAAAAAADw0/HGP9AARrl1w/s320/20_World_Summit_sff_300.jpg\" />When\nI saw them on television I was reminded of the 60s when demonstrations were held by\nflower-bedecked 'hippies' to make love not war. I wanted to go downtown and join them. If only\nI was 18 again. Here is a 2010 flower child, wanting to share her daisies with a cop in full\nriot gear.<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 199px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487880717780293154\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GkLjqwzywZ0/TCjeb9ECliI/AAAAAAAADws/uSiq_UvkTU4/s320/19_World_Summit_sff_300.jpg\" /><br />\nI never doubted that our police force, as well as thousands of police officers from other\ncities, would be able to handle the demonstrators. But on Saturday, I was astounded to see\nviolence and mayhem on our city streets. A group, calling themselves, the 'Black Bloc'\nsplintered off from the main protesters. They wore black clothing and had their faces covered\nby balaclavas or bandannas in order to hide their identities. They started smashing store\nwindows with anything they could find like bricks and boards. On other buildings they spray\npainted obscene graffiti. They eventually set fire to or destroyed four police cars. I watched\nthe scenes play out in horror on my television - from the safety of my living room. What I\nreally found interesting was that everyone at the scene seemed to have a camera or cell phone\nand was taking photos. I hoped that everyone of those violent protesters would eventually be\nidentified and arrested.<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 260px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5487883685203007794\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GkLjqwzywZ0/TCjhIrkv2TI/AAAAAAAADxE/SlUx7Rp2YqE/s320/8_APTOPIX_World_Summit_sff.jpg\" />Our\npolice have come under harsh criticism for their actions this past weekend. Some people\nbelieve that they didn't do enough to stop the thugs who tried to take over our city. Others\nclaim that their actions were not democratic and should have been more fair. Many of the\n'Black Bloc' were arrested and charged. In fact, it was reported that over 900 people had been\ndetained and/or questioned over the weekend. I am proud of our police, even though they had to\nresort to firing teargas and rubber bullets into the unruly crowd for the first time in\nToronto's history.<br />\n<br />\nThis whole thing has got me thinking. Our government spent over a billion dollars for security\nthis past weekend. Wouldn't it have been better to spend that money on poverty, maternal\nhealth, the economy or whatever else they discussed at their Summit? The leaders could have\nparticipated in a teleconferencing Summit, each safe in his/her own country. But I understand\nthe limited photo ops in that plan. I guess we can't have it all. Peace without policing.\nGovernment spending without a Summit. Photo ops without cameras.<br />\n<br />\nNow it is time to clean up the mess left in the downtown area. I hope our city can go back to\njust being Toronto the <del>Boring</del> Good. That's the way I like it.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n</div>"], ["Dylan Leeder: G20 Chaos.", "http://dylanleeder.blogspot.com/2010/07/g20-chaos.html", "Dylan Leeder", "http://dylanleeder.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>I feel that the following post I'm about to write needs a\nquick disclaimer/explanation.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, I AM NOT AN ANARCHIST, nor do I believe that anarchy is a sensible form of society. To\nme; believing that it's beneficial for society to have an absence of government is ridiculous;\npeople are simply too concerned with themselves to ever have a functioning society without\nsome kind of political law and order. To me anarchy would destroy the world faster than any\nalready destructive force. Saying that, I DO NOT believe that what the \"Black Bloc\" did in\nToronto is justified at all. To me smashing store fronts and yelling \"FUCK CONSUMERISM!\" is a\nuneducated, attention seeking, angst filled action that is not warranted at all. I believe\nthat 95% of the \"anarchists\" out on Saturday just wanted to be able to tell there fellow\npunkxcore friends that they are so against the system they smashed a piece of glass. What I\nsay to them: find an outlet that will actually make a difference; get into politics and\nexpress your opinions in a matter that doesn't make you look like attention seeking assholes\nto the rest of the world.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, I attended the protests as a photographer. I attended to take photos and show the\nworld what is happening. Awareness is very important to me. People are constantly saying that\n\"well, you wouldn't have been arrested if you just didn't go\" and to them I say this;\nPhotographers/Media's roll are to show you what is happening without you having to risk\nyourself. We are here to inform you of current events in ways that make an impact and\nhopefully encourage you to stay informed, or even, get involved... it's always been said that\na picture means a thousand words. Also, to be honest...- yes, I was attracted to the high\nlevel of energy photographing such an event and I don't believe this is wrong; it's the same\nreason I shoot metal shows. Shooting an event where you never know what's going to happen and\nthe level of emotion brought out in high energy events like this make for truly unforgettable\nimages. A fellow photographer/friend Thomas Dagg recently said \"I think most photographers\nwould be drawn to photograph an event like that; capturing raw emotion unfiltered\".<br />\n<br />\nAs a photographer I tried my hardest to stay as neutral as possible; to let viewers of my\nphotos decide their own perspective on the things they are seeing. BUT, after the things I saw\nand the way I was treated I can no longer do this. After being out for the first 45 minutes I\nhad already found myself frustrated with the police force present. So, yes, the post you're\nabout to get into (and it's going to be a long one) is from the perspective of a protester,\nbecause I think that any sensible person is going to get angry after seeing a mans prosthetic\nleg ripped off or people run over by horses.<br />\n<br />\nSo... Here we go.<br />\n<br />\nFriday:<br />\n<br />\nI initially went downtown to get photos of potential protesters but to my surprise there were\nnone by the fences.

They checked my bags,\nchecked my background by running my ID's through their system, wrote my description, including\nmy tattoos, and generally drilled me with questions. When I asked why they were doing so they\nsaid that anyone within 5 meters of the fence was to be questioned and searched. The Toronto\nPolice Chief recently admitted that the law did not actually exist and that \"He was just\ntrying to keep the criminals out\".

That the Toronto Police Force left them to\nwarrant their spending of 1.1 Billion dollars for security. Having been at the front of the\ndestructive march (It's the best place for photographic opportunities) I consider myself an\neye witness to how casually the police left the cars abandoned. After seeing the mob about a\n1-2 blocks away I saw them speed walk away from their cars and setting up a perimeter about a\nblock down. They stayed there without moving while their cars were destroyed.<br />\n<br />\nNow I STRONGLY recommend everyone watch Naomi Kleins extremely powerful speech infront of the\npolice headquarters during a protest. In it she speaks of the decoy cars and the spending on\nsecurity. She mentions that while the cars were burning she was getting press from the Police\nsaying \"Look what's happening!\" instead of actually doing something about it:<br />\n<br />\n<object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\"\nvalue=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rkQK9uP8ok0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\" />\n<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<embed\nsrc=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rkQK9uP8ok0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\"\ntype=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"340\" /></object><br />\n<br />\nAfter the mob took to the streets they finally ended up at Queen and University where the\npolice finally decided to make a move.

But, this time the police decided to actually take\naction - in many cases wrongfully.<br />\nDuring my time I was able to really experience riot squads tactics and it wasn't pretty. One\nof their most common tactics is to scare the crowd by smashing their shields, than shoot tear\ngas, than run full speed at the protesters and take them down by the neck.

One man, an amputee, was even torn down by his\nneck (where they aimed for), beaten, and then had his prosthetic leg ripped off only to be\narrested. Disgusting.

I shot everything with my 5d Mark II and a 50mm...\nwhich I found was a little too personal at times.

I heard\nabout a bicycle protest and thought I would check that out and than head home being tired from\nthe day before.<br />\n<br />\nI started the day off by taking photos of the boarded up shops. The black bloc tactic was\nselective in the business's they destroyed and only smashed the storefronts of the major\ncorporations.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749604751/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4749604751_eddf34a8b0_b.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"720\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749603639/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4749603639_ef83068590_b.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"720\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750247870/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4750247870_cd7ba340cd_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nI than continued south to where the fences were located and took a few photos of them.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749601171/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4749601171_727d1dce58_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750244968/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4750244968_e1fd8e66d5_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749600879/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4749600879_1957f1a449_b.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"720\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749600169/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4749600169_ab061a6259_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750244024/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4750244024_a52783068e_b.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"720\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nAnd than I ended up at Queen and Spadina. I'm sure many of you heard about the incident at\nQueen and Spadina but here I will tell my story first hand.<br />\n<br />\nThere was an organized march down Queen that was suddenly stopped by police at Spadina street.\nProtesters began to yell \"Let us march!\" but the police insisted on keeping everyone there.

Like\nI said, everyone was peaceful and under-control. The bike cops already there were more than\nenough to keep peace.<br />\n<br />\nThan they initiated the \"Kettle\" tactic. Wikipedia explains it as:<br />\n\"Kettling, also known as containment or corralling, is a police tactic for the management of\nlarge crowds during demonstrations or protests. It involves the formation of large cordons of\npolice officers who then move to contain a crowd within a limited area. Protesters are\nprevented from leaving the area for several hours; as a result, detainees can be denied access\nto food, water and toilet facilities for a long period.\"<br />\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling\"><br />\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling</a><br />\n<br />\nThe use of this tactic was COMPLETELY uncalled for. To use such a harsh tactic on a harmless\nprotest is absurd.<br />\n<br />\nHere's an article about the police defending themselves for using the tactic:<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/829642--police-defend-crowd-trap-at-queen-and-spadina?bn=1\">\n<br />\nhttp://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/829642--police-defend-crowd-trap-at-queen-and-spadina?bn=1</a><br />\n<br />\nWhen I first saw them marching down the street I had no idea that they were or would\ncompletely block us in. At the time I never thought that they could do such a thing. So, I\nstuck around and did what I was there to do; take pictures.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749595845/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4749595845_4bdc3c0b04_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750238950/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4750238950_7d68830c31_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750239952/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4750239952_5799fb92f4_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4749597061/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4749597061_b6ecb2feb1_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nAs time went on people started to get a little freaked out. People started crying and begging\nthe police to just let them leave. I met quite a few people that said they were there simply\nbecause they happened to be walking down the street.<br />\n<br />\nIn this photo you can see that the police had blocked off the last exit to the area. We were\nofficially blocked in.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750241188/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4750241188_b8c37a1f70_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nAfter I realized we were blocked in I decided to put my camera away to keep it safe. I could\nsee the rain coming and It looked as if the police were about to open fire on the crowd with\neither tear gas or rubber bullets. I made one last video before it became about my personal\nwell being and not my photography.<br />\n<br />\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\"\nvalue=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/MZ1rWMLgh7A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\" />\n<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" />\n<embed\nsrc=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/MZ1rWMLgh7A&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999\"\ntype=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\nwidth=\"425\" height=\"344\" /></object><br />\n<br />\n(My mom wasn't pissed. She's actually extremely supportive.)<br />\n<br />\nAnd then I was arrested.<br />\n<br />\nClearly I was unable to take any pictures after I was arrested because they took all of my\nbelongings but I'm going to do my best to explain the situation and what happened.<br />\n<br />\nAfter they declared everyone was going to be arrested I didn't believe it. I didn't believe\nthat they could ever arrest that many people for no reason. I waited around a little bit\nthinking that they would let people go at some point but as time went on I realized that that\nwasn't going to happen.<br />\n<br />\nI started seeing media give themselves up to the police and assumed that they were being let\ngo somewhere behind where I couldn't see. I realized after that that wasn't the case because I\nlater saw them detained as well. So, I decided to give myself up. I felt that it was the best\nidea as I was still afraid they were going to open fire on the crowd and didn't want to have\nmy camera gear damaged. I also thought if I gave myself up I'd have more of a chance to be let\ngo and that maybe they wouldn't tackle me like I was watching them do to others; I was\nwrong.<br />\n<br />\nHere is a photo I found right before I was arrested. I'm at the bottom left corner with my\nhands in the air, black hair and black shirt.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4743554248/\"\ntitle=\"I'm in this. by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4743554248_b467836ba2_b.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\"\nalt=\"I'm in this.\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nAfter that they took me down. They grabbed me by the back of the neck, kicked the back of my\nknees, than put their knees into my back. The whole time I was trying to explain that I was\njust a photographer and was not there to protest. This didn't matter as all they replied with\nwas \"You should have thought about that before you came here\". Rediculous.<br />\n<br />\nThey then used plastic ties to secure my hands together behind my back. Very uncomfortable. As\nthey were arresting me they declared that I was under arrest for disturbing the peace. Are\nthey serious? When did taking pictures become \"disturbing the peace\"? Yes, I was yelling at\nthem after they had us squared off because, well, I was extremely pissed off. But, at that\npoint all they knew was that I was a photographer.<br />\n<br />\nThen it started to pour rain. They grabbed me by the arm and started walking towards awnings\nclose by; so I'm thinking that they may have the decency to keep me out of the rain... wrong\nagain. They stood themselves under the awnings and held everyone in the rain. When I asked why\nthey were doing that they simply said \"you deserve it\" and again that \"I should have thought\nabout this before\". In what seemed like seconds I was completely soaked; every article of\nclothing I was wearing was totally drenched.<br />\n<br />\nThey stood us in the rain, took down all of our information, told us our rights, and then\nasked if I wanted to call a lawyer. Having never been in that situation before I didn't know\nif I should or not and they were definitely not willing to give me any advice- so I decided\nnot to. I didn't want to make the situation any bigger than it already was.<br />\n<br />\nNow, I feel that I'm obligated to tell you that the police officers that held me were\ngenerally nice. The guy that had to stand with me the longest (I was handed off to him after\nthe line moved into the rain) admitted he was disappointed he had to meet me under such\ncircumstances. He even agreed to buy me a beer if he ever saw me again; I told him he owed me.\nThis really showed that a lot of the officers were just doing their jobs and following orders.\nOrders that I wouldn't agree to do but that's why I'm not a police officer. I always made a\npoint to thank the police officers that were respectful towards me and they always replied\nwith \"I'm just doing my job\"; and to the ones that were rude to me got the same attitude in\nreturn.<br />\n<br />\nWhile being held there was a lot of teasing towards the \"prisoners\". Comments such as \"Have\nfun where you're going!\" or \"not so tough now\" or \"look where protesting got you!\". At times\nit seemed like they were enjoying it.<br />\n<br />\nAfter standing in the rain for about an hour my plastic ties were switched with metal\nhandcuffs and I was pushed onto a police bus. They took our pictures as they put us on a\npolice bus. The bus had plastic seats and was split into sections with metal bars. At the\nfront of the bus there were individual seats with cages around them; they placed the females\nin these.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I got on the bus I met a few really good people, we shared stories and explained our\nreasons for being at Queen/Spadina. The man beside me explained that he lived a block down and\njust wanted to see what was going on in his neighbourhood. Another man said he was simply\npassing through on his bike.<br />\n<br />\nWe were already all shaking from being so cold/wet and then they decided to put the air\nconditioning on. It seemed like a form of torture. Everyone on the bus immediately started\nyelling to turn it off but they didn't for a matter of hours. They finally turned it off only\nto turn it back on a half hour later. Everyone on the bus was miserable and extremely pissed\noff.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the bus finally started moving the tension cleared a little as everyone put a twist on\none of the popular chants of the weekend. Instead of \"Who's streets!? OUR STREETS!\" it became\n\"Who's bus!? OUR BUS\" with a series of laughter after each one. This made everyone feel a bit\nbetter until we arrived at the detention center.<br />\n<br />\nThe bus sat outside the detention center for a few hours, just sitting there. During this time\nwe all made friends and tried to keep each other distracted. At one point I was the host of a\ngame of hangman written in the fog on the windows; I chose the word \"Freedom\" but realized\nthat was a bad idea as everyone immediately guessed it... we were all thinking it.<br />\n<br />\nThey then moved the bus into the detention center and it seemed the whole bus gasped at the\nsame time. It was terrible. People were caged like animals. I immediately thought of the movie\n\"Children Of Men\". They were not as packed as Children Of Men but it definitely had a\nresemblance with all the caged people. The port-a-potties all had their doors removed so\nnobody had any privacy. Females would build walls around the doors so that other females had\nthe privacy to go to the washroom without the cops or other prisoners watching. There were\ncheese \"sandwiches\" littering the floor; and by sandwiches I mean two pieces of white bread\nand a single cheese slice.<br />\n<br />\nThey then continued to leave us on the bus for a few more hours and it only got worse. It got\nto the point where with the humidity off of everyones wet clothing and our breathing, the air\non the bus became very sparce. People were starting to have panic attacks thinking we were not\ngoing to be able to breath. We then banged on the windows yelling \"WE NEED AIR!\" and we got no\nreaction. It took us about 2 hours to get them to finally open the doors to let air in; and\nthat didn't help much. At one point a man on my bus declared a medical emergency as his\ndiabetes was acting up due to not being fed for hours. The police responded again with \"you\nshould have thought about that\" and \"if you pass out there's a doctor somewhere in here\". The\ndiabetic was not helped until a few hours later when we were finally let off the bus.<br />\n<br />\nWhen we left the bus they sat us on the cement floor to pair up our prisoner numbers with our\n\"evidence\" bags. My number, 5356, was finally called and I was directed into the other room. I\nimmediately struck up conversation with the police officer asking if she'd ever saw Children\nOf Men and she replied with \"Wait until you see the other rooms\". What!? This isn't it?!<br />\n<br />\nGoing through the other rooms was horrible. Disgusting. Picture a 15 year old crying in the\ncorner of a cage begging to be let out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Endless hallways\nof caged people. Felt like walking through a dog kennel for people.<br />\n<br />\nThey then gave me my stuff, took my picture again, and made us agree that we would not\nparticipate in any more G20 protests. Luckily I was leaving the city the next day. The last\nprisoner I saw was about to be let go when he started yelling that they lost his stuff; he\ndidn't have his wallet, shoes, or coat. The police officers responded with \"Oh okay, we'll\nleave you in here for a few more hours while we look for your stuff\" while laughing.<br />\n<br />\nAfter six hours I was finally let out. I was extremely lucky that day. I did not have to sit\nin the cages and I was only there for six hours. Some people had been in there for over 20\nhours, barely fed and barely given any water.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the last photo I took. The exit to the detention center:<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dylanleeder/4750238528/\"\ntitle=\"G20 - Sunday by dylanleeder, on Flickr\"><img\nsrc=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4750238528_c3d769e878_b.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"\nalt=\"G20 - Sunday\" /></a><br />\n<br />\nAfter leaving the place I was greeted by protesters protesting the way they were holding\npeople. They offered me free pizza and water knowing they weren't feeding anyone inside. I was\neven given a ride home by a stranger. I truly love how things like this bring people\ntogether.<br />\n<br />\nHere is a link to photos of inside the detention center:<br />\n<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://www.blogto.com/city/2010/06/inside_the_g20_eastern_avenue_detention_centre/\">http://www.blogto.com/city/2010/06/inside_the_g20_eastern_avenue_detention_centre/<br />\n</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSo, that's my rant. Thank you so much for reading/viewing it. Now, all I ask is that you tell\npeople. Tell people what you have heard and voice your opinions. Again, this is all from my\nstandpoint having been through the whole thing. You may think it's warranted but, personally,\nI don't believe the police have the rights to arrest people/treat people the way they\ndid.<br />\n<br />\nThanks again!<br />\n- Dylan<br />\n<br />\nOH, And happy Canada Day!</div>"], ["A birthday to remember: How we found ourselves at the heart of student rioting | Daisy's Blog", "http://daisybambridge.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/a-birthday-to-remember-how-we-found-ourselves-at-the-heart-of-student-rioting/", "personal &laquo; WordPress.com Tag Feed", "http://wordpress.com/tag/personal", "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>As I grow older my birthday becomes a little more mundane and I have to admit the\nexcitement is lost compared to when I was under 20. So deciding to cover the national student\nprotest for the day seemed like an exciting way to spend the day which I would probably\notherwise only have been doing some sort of essay or coursework.</p>\n<p>So zoom and camera in hand, Lucy and I headed to the UCU for the student media press\nconference with the NUS president and president of UCU, the institutions organising the\ndemonstration.</p>\n<p>Little did we expect the day to turn into such chaos let alone that we would unwittingly\nfind ourselves at the very heart of all the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Peaceful start</strong></p>\n<p>After the press conference where <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Aaron Porter\" rel=\"wikipedia\"\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Porter\">Aaron Porter</a>, the NUS president,\nreassured us that the demonstration would be the beginning to a national fight against the\nuniversity fee increase and that violence would not occur we headed to the congregation point\nat Horse Guard Avenue.</p>\n<p>I have never been to anything like this before and so I certainly had no idea what to\nexpect. As we joined the already mile long group of protesters as they marched down the <a\nclass=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Horse Guards Avenue\" rel=\"geolocation\"\nhref=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5049,-0.1249&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=51.5049,-0.1249 (Horse%20Guards%20Avenue)&amp;t=h\">\nHorse Guards Avenue</a> towards Millbank and the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tate\"\nrel=\"geolocation\"\nhref=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.491,-0.127&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=51.491,-0.127 (Tate)&amp;t=h\">\nTate Gallery</a> we conducted a few vox pops, recorded a few chants and took some pictures to\ncapture the moment.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_759\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a\nhref=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/011.jpg\"><img\nclass=\"size-medium wp-image-759\" title=\"011\"\nsrc=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/011.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" alt=\"\"\nwidth=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Protesters</p>\n</div>\n<p>It started off quite exciting. The atmosphere created by the crowds fighting for something\nthey all felt so passionate about was inspiring and it became difficult to remain professional\nand impartial as journalists.

It's not exactly the best impression to make for an MP to run away\nfrom a student journalist when the very thing people are fighting for is the rights of\nstudents.

What\nwere that chances that we just happened to have lunch right next to the Conservative\nHeadquarters. We couldn't believe our luck. We were considering heading on to the final\nmeeting point at the Tate further down the road in which case we would have missed what was\ngoing on.</p>\n<p>We hurriedly finished our meal, downed the win (Lad!), paid and made a dash for it into the\ncrowd outside.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaos</strong></p>\n<p>I literally couldn't believe it. The whole courtyard was rammed with protesters and people\nwere shaking the glass entrance and throwing things at it so that it would smash.</p>\n<p>All around us people were chanting, cheering and shouting. A fire started in the centre of\nthe crowds. It got pretty big as people began throwing their placards on it.</p>\n<p>We sat, pride of place, on the railings which separated the raised area surrounding the\ncourtyard. We had an overview of everything that was happening. Although, to our dismay, the\ncrowd of people in front of us were inhibiting our view of the entrance of the building but we\ncould see enough to know what was happening.</p>\n<p>In true journo style we brought out the zoom and asked a few people around us what was\ngoing on. We also we fairly proud of ourselves in creating a war type correspondent package at\nthe scene.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_761\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 235px\"><a\nhref=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/37138_469227437056_506217056_6013381_4651532_n.jpg\">\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-761\" title=\"flare at protest\"\nsrc=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/37138_469227437056_506217056_6013381_4651532_n.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300\"\nalt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Playing with fire</p>\n</div>\n<p>I'm not going to lie. Or act hard core. I feared for my life when a flare was lit next to\nus and the crowd pushed back into us. I was only sitting on a very small rail and could see,\nany second, someone would push slightly too hard and I would go falling, head first, onto the\nconcrete below and probably, while there, get trampled on by the protesters.</p>\n<p>The <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Riot control\" rel=\"wikipedia\"\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control\">riot police</a> stormed through the crowds as\na group peered over the edge of the roof of the building down at the crowds below. The people\nwho had got into the building had stripped the glass windows off the front of the building.\nThe walls were covered in derogatory graffiti, displaying obscenities towards the <a\nclass=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Conservative Party (UK)\" rel=\"homepage\"\nhref=\"http://www.conservatives.com/\">Conservative party</a>.</p>\n<p>Plants from inside the building were thrown out of windows and passed through the crowds.\nFire extinguishers made it feel almost magical as they were set off from above and the foam\ncame falling through the sky like snow. Rolls of toilet paper and old newspapers and banana\nskins were also thrown out of the windows.</p>\n<p>The police barricaded the entrance to stop more people getting into the building as the\nhelicopters above surrounded.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you one thing about mobs. They do not like the police. I was shocked at the way\nthe crowds jeered at them and shouted abuse when all they were trying to do was control the\nsituation which looked like it was going to escalate.</p>\n<p>And then suddenly, after a few minutes of mulling it over, we decided to make our way to\nthe front of the crowds to where the proper press were. Right opposite the police wall.</p>\n<p>As we pushed our way to the front placards and bottles were thrown over our head. When we\nreached the front a bottle skimmed past Lucy's eye, and another hit my back. As one girl\nshoved a policeman with a wooden stick she slid on the glass on the floor and before we knew\nit both the police and other protesters seemed to congregate around her and almost attack her.\nWe got pushed around and slide on the glass.</p>\n<p>That was when I knew we had to get out. It was just becoming too dangerous. As the\nafternoon progressed people were finding new things to through and there was glass\neverywhere.</p>\n<p>We headed to that back but just couldn't quite drag ourselves away. So we ventured up a\nstairwell at the back of the courtyard. It was a fantastic place to overlook the mob\nbelow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_762\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a\nhref=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/029.jpg\"><img\nclass=\"size-medium wp-image-762\" title=\"Break in to tory hq\"\nsrc=\"http://daisybambridge.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/029.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\" alt=\"\"\nwidth=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riot at Milbank</p>\n</div>\n<p>A boy walked past to show his friend why they couldn't get in and I soon realised people\nwere trying to get in the building at this entrance as well but the police were protecting the\ndoor from the inside and so no one was getting in.</p>\n<p>By this time we were all mobbed out.

I predict a riot.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBrighton is a City that plays host to many different people from all walks of life, including\nthose who like to protest about, well, anything.<br />\n<br />\nI don't object to protests, I think that they're an important part of the freedom of speech\nthat we're allowed by right, but I do object to protesters turning into morons and turning\ntheir protest into a fight against the police for no other reason than to 'stick one to the\ngovernment'.<br />\n<br />\nIt's childish, dangerous and the moment they begin to riot instead of protest they've\nlost.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the main groups that we had a problem with was Smash EDO. EDO is a company that amongst\nother things makes bomb release catches for fighter planes, so the protest group decided that\nthey were responsible for the murder of innocent civilians. Unfortunately for us, EDO have a\nfactory on the outskirts of Brighton, and every Wednesday the group would cause problems\noutside.<br />\n<br />\nMost of the group were students and the usual crusty types who came along to shout at the\nwindows and wave banners, which is all fine and good, but there were a hardcore element that\nhad been involved in nasty campaigns over the years that wanted to cause some serious\ndamage.<br />\n<br />\nSo it started off with a lot of shouting and waving of placards, but pretty soon the\norganizers (who would never admit to their elevated status in case they got arrested), started\norganizing proper marches through the town.<br />\n<br />\nNormally, protest groups would talk to senior police officers, arrange a marching route, get\nadvised by the police, and then we'd all work hand in hand to ensure that everything went\nsmoothly and no one got hurt.<br />\nNot Smash EDO though, oh no.<br />\n<br />\nApparently, by turning up to police the demonstrations we were \"implicit in the murder\". I've\nhad that screamed in my face so many times I'll never forget it.<br />\nThey refused to talk to the police, stating that they had the freedom to demonstrate wherever\nthey wished and that the police would not be allowed to stop them.<br />\n<br />\nThis led, as you can probably imagine, to a lot of pushy shovey on the demos, and generated a\nlot of bad feeling on either side. Then Smash EDO started getting involved in other demos as\nwell. They were almost like rent-a-mob, turning up at any demo where there was a chance they\ncould scream at the police.<br />\n<br />\nI remember one particular demo in Eastbourne, where an Israeli tennis player was playing a\nmatch.<br />\n<br />\nHad I known the Lawn Tennis Association had so much sway over politics, maybe I would have\nspoken to them as well?<br />\n<br />\nThat particular demo ended up with me arresting one of the organizers for breaching section 14\nof the public order act. They'd been asked to stop using the megaphone as they were\ninterfering with the rehearsals of a play at the main theatre just across the road, and as\nsoon as the request was made this particular demonstrator grabbed the microphone and jammed it\nagainst the speaker, causing it to emit a horrific squealing noise which could probably be\nheard back in Brighton.<br />\n<br />\nMyself and another officer went to arrest him, and as soon as I approached he jammed his hand\nin his pocket, knowing full well that I'd see that as a threat and bend him up, which I\nobligingly did.<br />\n<br />\nNo sooner had I locked his arm safely behind his back than half a dozen cameras went off,\nfurther propaganda for their website of brutish and bullying tactics by the police.<br />\n<br />\nIn the van on the way to Hastings custody, we had plenty of time for idle conversation, so I\ndecided to ask him a question that had been bugging me for some time.<br />\n<br />\n\"Answer me this\", I said to my prisoner. \"Why is it, if you organize these?\"<br />\n\"I don't organize anything!\" He shouted immediately.<br />\n<br />\nI put my hands up in mock surrender. \"Okay, okay. Why is it, if you take part in these demo's,\nwhich cost the taxpayer a fortune and don't seem to solve anything, you don't just organize\npeople with buckets to go through the City Centre and collect money for the orphans of the\natrocities and wars that are going on. I'd donate, and I'm sure lots of other people would\ntoo. Wouldn't that be a more productive use of your time?\"<br />\n<br />\nHe looked at me for a long time, then shrugged and turned away.<br />\n\"Talk to me when you're out of uniform\", he muttered over his shoulder.<br />\nSo much for not being prejudiced?<br />\n<br />\nThe demo I remember most, though, is what was called a 'Peace carnival against the arms\ntrade'.<br />\n<br />\nIt started off on the Level in Brighton, a large park that's imaginatively named because it's,\nwell, level.<br />\n<br />\nI was working as a medic that day, and myself and about thirty other officers, including\nseveral observers from the Met and Thames police, were up at the EDO site on Home Farm Road,\nwhich is about half an hour's march from the level.<br />\n<br />\nThe command team were up there with us, and we were all listening to reports via our radios of\nLewes Road being completely snarled up by angry protesters.<br />\n<br />\nI personally know some of the anti-EDO protesters, and for the main they are nice people, but\nas soon as a demo starts it begins to get ugly, with face coverings supplying a level of\nanonymity that makes even the meekest brave.<br />\n<br />\nHome Farm Road climbs from the main road and is a dead end for traffic, with only a small\nfootpath at the far end, so we were effectively going to be boxed in when the protesters\narrived. There were several hundred of them, and our support units were still far back down\nthe Lewes Road being held up by a few wayward protesters when the march arrived.<br />\n<br />\nIn preparation for this, the three riot vans we had with us (which were full of the PSU kit\nthat most officers still didn't have on as it was deemed too threatening), were parked across\nthe road, and Ped barrier had been placed on one side of the road to give the protesters a\nsafe area to state their case in.<br />\n<br />\nOn one side of the road was the factory, fenced in with massive pointed strips of grey painted\nsteel, whereas the other had a low crash barrier and then a steep cliff-like slope that\ndropped about sixty feet to the ground below. Not exactly the safest place to start\ntrouble.<br />\n<br />\nI would like to remind you at this point that this had been billed as a peace march. No police\nofficer had attacked a protester, and nothing other than directions to march had been shouted\nat them by the police.<br />\n<br />\nSo why, I wonder, did the crowd suddenly surge towards us as they came into sight?<br />\nMost of them were wearing red cloth that covered the lower half of their faces, and seeing ten\ntimes your number charging towards you screaming in rage and hate is a chilling sight.<br />\n<br />\nWe were in a cordon across the road just behind the ped barrier, but the first thirty or so\nprotesters picked up the barriers, shook them loose from each other and hurled them at us,\ncausing the line to drop back.<br />\n<br />\nThe only officers there in full PSU gear including shields and helmets were myself and my\nfellow medic. All the other officers were wearing shin pads, but their shields, helmets and\narmguards were in the vans just behind us.<br />\n<br />\nI wasn't actually in the front line at this point, but floating just behind it ready to drag\nout any casualties for triage.<br />\n<br />\nAs the line surged back, the last bits of Ped were thrown and then the entire mass of\nprotesters charged the line, forcing it back behind the vans so that the officers had no way\nof kitting themselves up properly.<br />\n<br />\nThey were all screaming in rage, faces contorted like gargoyles brought to life and sent to\nkill. Gone were the friendly, card waving hippies; this was war.<br />\nI turned to see what the Bronze commander was doing, and heard something that chilled my\nblood.<br />\n<br />\nHere was the man who had overall control of the officers on the ground, and he was yelling\ninto his radio for urgent assistance. Then he drew his baton and leaped into the front\nline.<br />\n<br />\nSeeing our leader set such a good example, my colleague and I did the same. I ended up on the\nbarrier side of the road just above the massive drop, and I spent as much time trying to stop\nangry protesters from killing themselves as I did fighting people off.<br />\n<br />\nAs I looked out over the crowd, I saw one man, no more than twenty years old, open up his\nrucksack and pull out dozens of fist sized rocks. The bag must have weighed a ton, but he'd\ncarried it all the way and was now handing out the ammunition so that we could be pelted with\nheavy stones.<br />\n<br />\nThat, more than anything else, other than our backup being deliberately delayed by a handful\nof protesters on the Lewes Road, told me that this was all planned from the beginning.<br />\n<br />\nTurning back to the mob directly in front of me, I saw one kid about to fall off the cliff,\nhis fellow protesters so keen to get at us that they were inadvertently trying to kill him. I\nmade a grab for him, stopping him from falling but accidentally smacking the back of his head\nwith the butt end of my baton.<br />\n\"Oy, you're not supposed to hit me in the head!\" He yelled at me, totally unaware that I'd\njust saved his life.<br />\n<br />\n\"I'm really sorry mate, are you okay?\" I asked in return, having to yell above the screams and\nshouts.<br />\n<br />\nHe looked totally baffled at my response. \"Uh, yeah, yeah I'm fine, thanks\".<br />\nThen he disappeared off into the crowd, probably to fight a police officer who wasn't too much\nof a puzzle.<br />\n<br />\nThe day ground on, our backup finally arriving, which made the protesters stop attacking our\nline. Instead, they started trying to get through the gates and into the factory, so officers\nwere deployed with their backs against the metal, which wasn't a nice place to be.<br />\n<br />\nThe rest of the protesters were herded into an area on the far side of the road, where they\nperiodically threw themselves at us trying to force their way through the line.<br />\n<br />\nIt was here that I saw one of the most reckless and dangerous cases of parenting I've ever had\nthe misfortune to witness.<br />\n<br />\nPicture this, if you will.<br />\n<br />\nA mob of angry protesters, already having attacked the police with weapons and without\nprovocation. A double line of exhausted and battered police officers, outnumbered seven or\neight to one. Between the line and the mob was a space of about ten feet, and in that space\nanyone who approached the line was arrested as if they weren't they would try and attack the\npolice.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral charges have been made by the police to keep the protesters back, and that space is\nthe most dangerous place in the whole of Brighton right now.<br />\n<br />\nSo one of the protesters, a woman in her early thirties with dreadlocks and a hard expression,\ncarries her two year old child into the space. She walks up and down the police line within\ntouching distance, challenging them to arrest her while her baby looks on in puzzlement.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the protesters began to use her as a shield, forming up to charge the line, and if it\nhadn't been for the child's safety I would have broken through and arrested her myself.<br />\n<br />\nProtesting for what you believe in is a right that we all share. But if you're going to take\nyour children along, LEAVE WHEN IT GETS DANGEROUS. Don't make their choice for them, because\nthe freedom to make a choice is the most important one we have, and by making the choice for\nyour child when they can't, you're betraying everything you stand for.<br />\n<br />\nStill angry.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOh, and the picture is actually from that demo. It's a shame it didn't take in the hundreds\nbehind them queuing to grab barriers and hurl rocks.</div>"], ["Moo-chan in the big BIG world: Dear Diary, Demo2010 Students march against cuts", "http://la-mooey.blogspot.com/2010/11/dear-diary-demo2010-students-march.html", "Moo-chan in the big BIG world", "http://la-mooey.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>Dear Diary, today Jesse and I caught the hired Manchester\ncoach down to London for <a style=\"color: rgb(204, 51, 204);\"\nhref=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/video/2010/nov/10/students-demonstrations-london-protest\">\nDemo 2010</a>, it was a long but very rewarding march, the majority of it was peaceful and\nfull of chants- the most common being: 'Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning\nblue' and 'no ifs, no buts, no education cuts'! It was cold, but the shear number and\ndiversity of people that marched alongside me, against the impending (up to) 3-fold increase\nin tuition fees and cuts imposed by the government on further and higher education, by far\nmade up for the chilly winds, sore throats and achy legs. The march began at Embankment and\nmade it's way to Parliament where there was a rally and continued on to the Millbank Tower\n(aka Conservative HQ) where a blockade began, which was followed by the burning of placards\nand overtaking of the roof by several students- as more protesters and media crews arrived, a\nwindow was kicked in and police started to arrive- by which Jesse and I had just taken our\nleave. Riot police arrived shortly after as we were heading back into town for food- so\nproceeding events I am not sure of.<br />\nOverall, despite what the papers tomorrow may say- it was a successful march and for the\nmajority was peaceful. I hope the government understands that raising tuition fees to the\nextent that they'll become one of the highest in the world will not only put off international\nstudents from studying here but also our own; it's completely unfair that the coalition\ngovernment is giving us the students the brunt of the cuts when really we should be invested\nin. When education fees are increased there's no going back. I'd love to see my younger\nbrother graduate from university in the UK- but as it stands, it'll be far too expensive and\nhe'll most likely end up having to go abroad for further education- ridiculous.<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NB3aRStTby0/TNxvy7L4QxI/AAAAAAAAArI/UK8drRwHrLc/s1600/demo2010.JPG\">\n<img style=\"cursor: pointer; width: 267px; height: 200px;\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NB3aRStTby0/TNxvy7L4QxI/AAAAAAAAArI/UK8drRwHrLc/s400/demo2010.JPG\"\nalt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5538424562430526226\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NB3aRStTby0/TNxvyoyRzQI/AAAAAAAAArA/22MmrpFS998/s1600/DSCN3432.JPG\">\n<img style=\"cursor: pointer; width: 267px; height: 200px;\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_NB3aRStTby0/TNxvyoyRzQI/AAAAAAAAArA/22MmrpFS998/s400/DSCN3432.JPG\"\nalt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5538424557491309826\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">I have more photo's of the demonstration <a\nstyle=\"color: rgb(204, 51, 204);\"\nhref=\"http://s923.photobucket.com/albums/ad77/Mooeyyy/Demo%202010%20UK%20students%20against%20cuts/\">\nhere</a><br />\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span\nstyle=\"color: rgb(204, 51, 204); font-weight: bold;\">X</span><br />\n</div>\n</div>"], ["It's a hard knock life: The Student Riots Part One...'No Ifs, No Buts, No Education Cuts'", "http://vixivix.blogspot.com/2010/11/student-riots-part-oneno-ifs-no-buts-no.html", "It's a hard knock life", "http://vixivix.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'><a\nonblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\nhref=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9HVQgLykd8M/TO00oo3XwFI/AAAAAAAAAEM/gWxCXHY8ryE/s1600/max%2Band%2Bi.jpg\">\n<img\nstyle=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 276px;\"\nsrc=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9HVQgLykd8M/TO00oo3XwFI/AAAAAAAAAEM/gWxCXHY8ryE/s400/max%2Band%2Bi.jpg\"\nalt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5543144589132021842\" border=\"0\" /></a> Max, Me and Mr Educate\nDon't Segregate<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">So as 'Student Riots' part two commences (unfortunately\nwithout my attendance this time - perhaps I'll be able to make the third instalment?) I\nremembered that I never put up the piece I wrote when Mr Max Clarke (see above) and I decided\nwe would pop down for a gander. So here is the intro / personal piece I wrote for the company\nblog - it doesn't contain my usual, lets say, silliness, but then apparently I have been a bit\n\"fiery\" recently for some softer touches, so perhaps this will appease more,\ncough.</span><br />\n<br />\n<p>It was meant to be a noisy, but good-natured student protest against raising tuition\nfees.</p>\n<p>Many had spent weeks organising and rallying for the planned November 10th London march.\nSubsidised coaches were booked and filled with students from all over the country, banners and\nposters were created, chants were scripted and rehearsed, and costumes were carefully prepared\nand fitted. Everyone was campaigning together to make Parliament hear the united student\nmessage, \"no ifs, no buts, no education cuts.\"</p>\n<p>But after the 20,000 expected to attend escalated to over 50,000, and a small minority\ndecided to take things into their own hands, all previous hard work became over-shadowed by\nthe violent rampages that filled both the streets - and the headlines.</p>\n<p>Millbank, the Tory HQ was the prime target, and had to be evacuated as the angry mob\nsmashed their way into the building. They destroyed windows, stole 'souvenirs' and bombarded\nthe roof where many threw objects - including a fire extinguisher which narrowly missed a\npoliceman- into the chanting crowd below.</p>\n<p>Fires fuelled by the placards were further lit outside, flares were let off and graffiti\ndisplaying 'Tory Pigs' was scrawled all over the Millbank walls.</p>\n<p>With 50 people eventually arrested in connection to the violence, and police today saying\nthat the protester who threw the extinguisher should face an attempted murder charge, it seems\nthat the message from the original peaceful demonstration has been forgotten, and many will be\nleft disappointed.</p>\n<p>Aaron Porter, the president of the National Union of Students agreed that his cause had\n\"lost a lot of public sympathy\" because of the violence, and that those who had caused\ncriminal damage had '\"undermined\" their argument.</p>\n<p>David Cameron, who is currently in Seoul attending the G20 summit, condemned those\nresponsible for hostilities, and confirmed that the government wouldn't go back on plans to\nraise tuition fees as a result of it: \"Look, even if we wanted to, we shouldn't go back to the\nidea that university is free,\" he finished.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br />\n</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span\nstyle=\"font-weight: bold;\">And now an account of the event as reported by, yes!

After seeing the chaos of the student\nriots that had been erupting across the media, we were expecting to be greeted with an\noverwhelming spectacle.<br />\nYet, initially, it seemed business was as usual.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">However, the placards, face paints and crude slogans soon\nstarted to appear as we climbed the underground escalators. \"When they say cut back we say\nfight back!\" shouted one of the signs, \"THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY!\" screamed another. Clearly,\nthe people were angry. \"It is just absolutely f*cking ridiculous\" one guy told me. \"University\nwill once again be for the rich, whilst the poor and unemployed can just clean the streets,\nwhat a joke.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">\"I'm not doing it for me,\" said Zoe Cleverly, a Bristol\nUniversity student who had come across for the day with a coach load of her Bristol peers.\n\"It's for my sister and her friends and my cousins and all the other people who will be\naffected. University is already TOO expensive - how can they possibly justify raising the fees\nhigher?\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">As we walked towards the beaten Millbank building,\ndifferent sing-song chants could be picked up in the gradually thickening crowds, and costumes\nchanged from a line of face paint, to the truly eccentric. The streets became a mardi gras of\nbear and tiger ensembles, all in one body-suits, an outfit made of \"money\", and a giant pair\nof cardboard scissors simulating the \"cuts\" as the students rallied together and fought for\ntheir cause.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">Yet, upon approaching Millbank, the more good-humoured\nwere quickly left behind and the jokey costumes rapidly changed to masks and balaclavas:\nattire, it was clear, that wasn't just being worn to keep out the cold.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">In fact, the angry spectacle illuminated by fires and\nriot police surrounding the Millbank entrance was quite shocking - even despite our previous\nmedia warnings. Voices on megaphones coaxed the enraged demonstrators, protesters on the roof\nwaved and teased the crowds below, and sticks, stones and any other throw-able objects filled\nthe air as they were hurled towards the entrance and blockading police.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">\"I'm just so disappointed\" despaired Col Leech of\nBournemouth University from the outskirts of the commotion. \"We had everyone down today and it\nwas really nice earlier on, it was quite cheerful, everyone was having a good time. And now,\nunfortunately, a few had to ruin it for everyone. I'm just so disgusted.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">\"It's just not fair,\" continued Emma Tunston, also a\nBournemouth university student. \"Even if you're angry at politicians - which is fair enough,\nwe're all angry - but to smash up something which is going to have to be cleared up by someone\nwho is probably working a low paid job, just trying to make money for their family is not\nfair.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">\"And it subtracts from the rest of us who have come here\nto say that the fee increases and the cuts are wrong. We've all stood there and shouted; we're\nall angry. But still, to come here and smash up private property I think is even more\nwrong.\"</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">The opinions regarding the violent uprising seemed to\nrange from absolute loathing of the few that had ruined \"what was a really good day\", to a\nshrug of, \"well as long as it gets the message across and no-one gets hurt - who cares?\"\n(Notably, the latter comment came from a smug hooded young man holding a plant which he\nproudly exclaimed he'd \"nicked from the Millbank entrance\").</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">Amazingly, the whole sorry affair became quite entrancing\nto outsiders like Max and I. Drums kept a regular chanting beat, 'boom boxes' provided a\nfestival-like quality, and flare guns lit up the increasing darkness. After a few hours we\nwere ready to leave, but the 'celebrations' looked to continue long into the night.<a\nhref=\"http://www.inspiringinterns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/millbank.jpg\"><br />\n</a></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">All in all, it was quite an incredible display of what a\ncombination of determined young minds and extensive social networking can achieve. On the\ndownside, it was also a reminder that there are always idiots prepared to take things too far,\nforget the law, and disgrace what was otherwise a commendably successful protest.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(51, 102, 255);\">Hopefully the guilty will be punished, lessons will be\nlearnt, and the peaceful protesters acknowledged as separate entities to their aggressive\ncounterparts.</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n</div>"], ["The Fouls Tribune: Don't piss in the kettle", "http://fouls.blogspot.com/2010/12/dont-piss-in-kettle.html", "The Fouls Tribune", "http://fouls.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>Since last posting here, I have become a full time\ndissident.<br />\n<br />\nWe did not rise early on Thursday. There was no need to: the Commons wouldn't be voting until\n5pm and the protest began at 12. We were marching to stop Nick Clegg from bringing off his\nlatest and most dastardly plot. The crowd assembled at ULU. Above us was the Apache helicopter\noff Wikileaks, ready to gun down with relish anyone seen carrying a beach umbrella. Around us\npeople were handing out flyers giving advice on what to do if we were arrested and earnest men\nwere debating the relative merits of mutualism and collectivism; speaking much as if the\nmatter would have to be settled by the end of the day, by which time we would have seized all\nmajor offices of state and it would be necessary for us to install some new form of government\n(or indeed <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">non-government</span>).<br />\n<br />\nThere was also a stall selling the Socialist Worker. My friends and I have long taken issue\nwith the Socialist Worker's \"F**K FEES\" slogan.<br />\n<br />\n\"You should have courage in your expletives,\" my friend told one of the people running the\nstall.<br />\n<br />\n\"That's actually an old argument,\" he replied, \"You know it's actually illegal to display\nobscenities and actually you can be prosecuted for it.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat's the spirit.<br />\n<br />\nSoon we were marching. My two friends and I had with us blackboards and chalk. On these we\nwrote withering, ironic phrases which we angled at passing media people. \"Don't piss in the\nkettle\" (accompanied by a picture of a kettle) was an early favourite.<br />\n<br />\nWe marched and marched and marched and when we reached the north side of Parliament Square we\nstopped. Now, it was apparently at this stage that we \"deviated from the agreed route\": we\nwere supposed to carry on up Whitehall then turn right and have a rally up by the Hungerford\nRailway Bridge.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThere are two things that it is worth saying about this. One, most of us had not heard\nanything about any agreed route and it seemed as though the way up Whitehall was blocked. Two,\nthe proposed rally point, up by the Hungerford Railway Bridge, is about three quarters of a\nkilometre from the House of Commons and isolated from politically iconic buildings.<br />\n<br />\nThe green on Parliament Square was protected by temporary fencing but some people broke it\ndown on the south side of the square and soon we had all piled in. As a crowd, we were pushing\nto the west towards the Palace of Westminster. Some sort of battling was going on at the front\nbut, back where we were, we practised our chants and drank whisky-laced coffee:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"Whose streets? Arse treats! Whose streets? Arse\ntreats!\"</span><br />\n<br />\nThis went on for some time and people began settling in, making fires from placards and so on.\nIt seems perversely radical to burn your own message.<br />\n<br />\nThen, for reasons few of us understood at the time, we all abandoned the eastern front and\ntried to scarper off down Victoria Steeet in the south-west corner of the square (I learned\nlater that we were trying to avoid being kettled and that this was the last way out of the\nsquare). It was in that corner that the Met had stationed its most ill-tempered employees. It\nhad hoisted some on enormous horses.<br />\n<br />\nThere was a certain amount of stick and smoke-bomb chucking going on. Soon, there were cries\nof \"make way, make way\" as young girls bleeding from the head were carried back through the\ncrowd. My friend, who is taller than me, said that from what he could see, one of the police\nofficers was a special maniac and might have been responsible for this.<br />\n<br />\nThen there was a cavalry charge. Trying to stay upright in a terrified crowd of hundreds of\npeople while carrying a blackboard and fleeing charging horses as fast as you can is\ndifficult. The Python Terry Jones used to say that he was tickled by the use of 'run away!' as\na military command and enjoyed putting it in the script of Holy Grail as many times as\npossible. On Thursday, it was the only command I had any use for. When I turned round I saw\ntwo figures standing among the horses holding each other. They each looked about four and a\nhalf feet tall. This little phase was later reported by Sky News as \"Mounted police attacked\nby protesters\".<br />\n<br />\nAs the crowd reformed, the mood changed. Time to redaub our chalky palimpsests with more\nserious-minded, horse-themed slogans. My friend came up with \"We met at the riding club\". I\nhad \"Courses not horses\". The fences around the green had been supported by concrete blocks;\npeople were now smashing these into smaller pieces to hurl at the police lines. While I\nwatched someone doing this, a man said to me that he thought throwing lumps of concrete was\ngoing too far. I suggested that so long as they were very small lumps - gravel-size, say - it\nmight not be that bad. Another man explained to him that he only had these reservations\nbecause he is English: in continental Europe they do this sort of thing all the time and\neverybody thinks it's fine - indeed, it is fine (he said).<br />\n<br />\nIt became clear that getting out on to Victoria Street was no longer possible. We drifted back\nto the green for a slow simmer in the kettle and waited for the outcome of the vote, which was\nto be announced some time after 5.30pm. We ate some homemade samosas and someone set fire to a\nplastic booth creating a vast column of black smoke. The air was seriously acrid and choking\nfrom this point on.<br />\n<br />\nWe had a little radio and were able to announce that the bill had passed to some nearby\npeople. No reaction. We booed a bit and then set about trying to leave. This turned out to be\nimpossible and one of my friends became separated from the other two of us.<br />\n<br />\nTwenty minutes later, I spotted him in a surging crowd of hundreds of people running away from\na police baton charge. I pulled him into the relatively calmer waters at the edge of the\nTreasury building. No sooner had we achieved this reunion than we became the front line. We\nwere some of the only people standing between police lines and people trying to break a\nTreasury window. A strong light shone on us from a helicopter far above.<br />\n<br />\nThe crowd began doing some fairly unusual multi-tasking. One eye had to be kept on the\nagitated police line but the other eye was needed to appraise the work of the window smashers\nwho, at this stage, were doing a clearly inadequate job. For one thing, they were hitting the\ncentral and most boingy window panes. For another, they were using blunt pieces of concrete.\nPeople began shouting advice: \"smash the wood!\"; \"no, smash the glass and then pull out the\nframe!\"; \"get a run up!\".<br />\n<br />\nEventually, some masked men turned up with a big metal pole and began lancing the window.\n\"Sorry, sorry. Excuse me,\" was their cry as they came through the crowd.<br />\n<br />\nA light came on inside the room, suggesting that there were police inside. This was a bad\nwindow, the crowd decided. There is a board behind it and, even though we've got through the\nglass, there'll be no getting through that board. Next window!<br />\n<br />\nThe next window had no board behind it and was helpless in the face of seasoned lancers. The\nblind was ripped out and burned. Hurrah! said the crowd.<br />\n<br />\nMy friend asked me what we would do if people started going in to the Treasury. Would we go\nin? There was no time to answer this question: the police had picked their moment and were\ncharging full pelt with their batons, whacking everyone in their way. Disarray ensued. My\nfriend and I were briefly part of a sit down protest. \"Sit down! Everyone sit down!\" we were\nyelling. Then the police charged again: \"Fuck! Don't sit down! Don't sit down!\"<br />\n<br />\nRunning away, we discovered a man smashing a Treasury door. With a little bit of help from\nothers, he was through and people began streaming into the building. Time for that question\nagain: are we going to go in? But, within seconds, everyone was streaming out again, as if\nrepelled by a dragon.<br />\n<br />\nThen began a long fight against the police officers inside using a piece of fencing. People\nsmashed the windows around the door and chucked in bangers. Some people managed to grab\ntruncheons. People hurled themselves at police shields. A masked boy opened a window that\nseemed to have been unlocked. Back in the audience, between 2 and 10 metres away, we were busy\ncontextualising. Storming the Treasury: the most significant bit of civil disobedience since\nthe poll tax riots, or even the Chartists. A new 1968.<br />\n<br />\nThe debate disbanded as police made another baton charge. At this point, we were in danger of\nbeing crushed between two separate police lines so we headed away from the Treasury down\ntowards the Supreme Court. In this, the most quiet part of the square, we encountered a\nFinancial Times journalist. She wanted to know what was going on but refused to go any nearer\nto the noisy section. We could have told her anything.<br />\n<br />\nFurther along, a pasty man who was bleeding from the head in two places was wobbling on his\nfeet and asking police if he might be allowed to leave in order to attend hospital. The police\ntold him that they were not going to let him through. Where had he got that bandage? they\nasked him. He had got it at first aid tent on the green, his friends told them. The police\nwere suspicious of this. The pasty man's companions were in a mood of perfect\nconsternation:<br />\n<br />\n\"What's the quickest way we can get him to hospital? Please get him an ambulance.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"All the ambulances are gone and I can't let you through.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter a lot more of this a police medic let him through.<br />\n<br />\nTowards the abbey, another police officer was moving batonless through the kettle rounding up\ntired people who wanted to leave. He proposed letting us leave in small groups from the\nsouth-east corner. We stood in a crowd in that corner for a long time. The police guarding the\nbarriers said they wanted young girls. The bored crowd offered this virginal sacrifice with no\nresistance but still we were not allowed to leave. An hour later, they police told us that\nthey wouldn't be letting us out after all.

As they\nformed their lines, someone played the Imperial March from Star Wars through a\nmegaphone.<br />\n<br />\nThen some good news: we were to be set free! Simply head up to Westminster Bridge and we'll\nlet you out. Thank you, police. Very kind. We read our what-to-do-if-you-get-arrested-slips\nand walked on to Westminster Bridge. The police line ahead of us halted and a new one formed\nbehind us. Much colder out on the bridge.

People had suggested riots etc but I really didn't pay\nmuch attention. So that second day in Barcelona we decided to walk from our hotel into the\ncity (20 min walk) and soak up the lovely scenery on the streets of Barca - in particular the\ngorgeous building facades. We arrived in town and Las Rambalas was a ghost town. It seemed\neveryone knew the metro, taxi and buses were not working today so spent the day lazing in\ntheir hotel room. There were a few stores open but all had security guards that were not\nnormally out the front.<br />\n<br />\nThe golden rule when you need to use the bathroom when travelling - you can always rely on the\ngolden arches (Mc Donalds). But even they had their roller doors half down at 10.30am. The\nword on the street and we had seen it on the news that morning (albeit in Spanish but we got\nthe jist of what they were saying). So everyone was avoiding Las Ramblas fearing a riot would\nbreak out. It seemed all peaceful but with only a couple of shops opened we headed down to the\nbeach for a stroll. A couple of my friends live in Barca and were expecting to have a baby any\nday whilst we were there. We arranged to meet them that evening in Las Ramblas at the Zurich\nbuilding cafe shop, which apparently is the meeting point for most locals. A few hours before\nwe were due to meet I received a text message from my friend advising that it would be safer\nto come to her apartment near Station de Sants as the riot was expected to commence at our\nagreed meeting time.<br />\n<br />\nSo we agreed and slowly walked back up to Las Ramblas - the scenes that we were greeted with\nwas crazy. We realised that something wasn't quiet right when we saw the huge bins they have\non the roadside for residents to use - tipped over in the middle of the main street which was\nnow very empty. There were police absolutely everywhere! Some were trying to pull the bins off\nthe road and back into an upright position - the rubbish spilling all over the roads was\ndisgusting.<br />\n<br />\nPeople were picking up the pace with their walk and getting where they needed to go fast. The\ncloser we get to the centre of town the more damage we see. It wasn't just the rubbish bins\nblocking streets, but smashed shop front windows and an awful lot of graffiti across shop\nwindows criticising capitalism and corporate greed. Shop window after shop window the paint\ncans had sprayed their messages loud and clear for all to see. I was turning into a journalist\nas I was madly taking photos -<br />\nI couldn't believe my beloved Barca had turned into the early stages of a war zone!<br />\n<br />\nBy the time we got to the top of Las Rambalas we met the riot police and there was an overhead\npolice helicopter watching the crowd. Somehow mum and I were right at the front of the group\nof police in riot gear armed with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields, helmets and batons and\nthere is me and a little 70 year old! I couldn't help myself and took a heap of photos just\nin-case they attacked the crowd when no-one was actually moving. You could actually see in the\ncrowd the young trouble makers who were just there so they can be violent and a nuisance. I\ndecided it was not safe for us there and that it was time to head home, so we weaved our way\nback through the crowd and continued down the street to our hotel. The destruction was\neverywhere and by now all stores were open before were quickly shutting down after hearing\nthat the protesters had gathered nearby.<br />\n<br />\nThings calmed down that night but watching the news we discovered that whilst we were\nstrolling down at the beach, revellers had set alight a police car - it was very chaotic and\nwe seemed to be just behind the excitement all the way.

Also, those naughty, naughty embedded journalists from the BBC had\nbeen telling the world that the protests had been cancelled. Tut, tut, that's not very neutral\n- or factual. It's interesting, if not surprising, that the BBC was happy to broadcast news\nthat there was no evidence for, simply in order to try to do the G8 a favour and turn\nprotesters back from the demonstrations.<br />\n<br />\nToday has been a day when the anti-capitalist movement has fought a good battle on many fronts\nand the disruption that they've caused to the G8 summit is not one tiny fraction of the\ndisruption and devastation that the policies of the G8 countries create.

One set of such activists at the Dissent rural\nconvergence centre in Stirling were confronted by police the moment they attempted to leave\ntheir encampment. But they were still able to block a key road, preventing bowler-hatted\napparatchiks getting to the summit on time.

This made a\nmockery of police assurances that they would comply with the Scottish Parliament decision to\nallow the protests to take place.<br />\n<br />\nMany coaches were detained outside of Stirling at the Broxden roundabout. Protesters became\nmore and more frustrated but as their numbers built up the police found it far more difficult\nto contain their potential anger. They were given an ultimatum: let us protest at Gleneagles\nor we protest here, cutting off western road links for the whole of Scotland.<br />\n<br />\nThe police had tried various tactics to explain why they thought it necessary to detain the\ncoaches, claiming that the anarchists had blocked off the road leading into Gleneagles. This\nwas completely untrue and a blatant attempt by the boys in blue to create divisions within our\nranks. At last the coaches were allowed to set off but only with a police escort chugging\nalong at ten miles an hour.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile in Edinburgh, thousands of protesters had been prevented from even getting on their\ncoaches and in frustration a vigorous blockade of Princes Street took place with 2000 angry\nanti-capitalists.

One of the protest\norganisers, Chris Nineham of Globalise Resistance, estimated that there were 10,000 protesters\nat the scene and we marched down to the steel fences that surrounded the conference centre.\nSome protesters took themselves into a nearby field as they were watched by rows of well-armed\nmounted police.<br />\n<br />\nThe scene was that of a well fortified encampment with lines of police and watchtowers with\nsearchlights and Chinook helicopters circling overhead.

Earlier there had been an almost carnival-like vibe in nearby Tahrir square,\nwhich demonstrators succeeded in occupying for most of the day; now at 1am the air was thick\nwith tear gas and thousands of people could be seen running out of Tahrir towards me. Several\nhundred regrouped and rallied in Al Galaa, a main road that leads up towards Cairo station;\nspotting an abandoned police truck, a few dozen protesters immediately set about attacking the\nvehicle, eventually tipping it over and setting it ablaze. Through the smoke, lines of riot\npolice could be seen charging towards us from the south.<br />\n<br />\nAlong with nearby protesters I fled back down the street before stopping at what appeared to\nbe a safe distance. A few ordinarily dressed young men were running in my direction, and I\nassumed they were demonstrators also escaping the oncoming security troops. Two came towards\nme and suddenly threw out punches, sending me to the ground. I was then hauled back up by the\nscruff of the neck and dragged towards the advancing police lines.<br />\n<br />\nMy captors were burly and wore leather jackets - up close I could see they were 'amin dowla,\nplain-clothes officers from Egypt's notorious state security service. All attempts I made to\ntell them in Arabic and English that I was an international journalist were met with more\npunches and slaps; around me I could make out other isolated protestors also being pulled\nalong, receiving the same brutal treatment and choking from the tear gas. We were all being\nhustled towards a security office on the edge of the square, only two streets away from my\napartment. As I approached the doorway of the building other plain clothes security officers\nmilling around took flying kicks and punches at me, pushing me to the floor on several\noccasions only to drag me back up and hit me again. I spotted a high-ranking uniformed\nofficer, and shouted at him that I was a British journalist. He responded by walking over and\npunching me twice. \"Fuck you and fuck Britain,\" he yelled in Arabic.<br />\n<br />\nOne by one the captured protesters and I were thrown through the doorway, where a gauntlet of\nofficers with sticks and clubs was awaiting us. We queued up to run through the blows and into\na dank, narrow corridor where we were pushed up against the wall. Our mobiles and wallets were\nremoved. Officers stalked up and down barking at us to keep staring at the wall and not look\nback, whilst the sounds of more protesters being shoved inside could be heard behind us.\nTerrified of incurring more beatings, most of my fellow detainees - almost exclusively young\nmen in their twenties and thirties, some still clutching dishevelled Egyptian flags from the\nprotest - remained completely silent, though some muttered Quranic verses under their breath\nand others were shaking with sobs.<br />\n<br />\nAfter what seemed like an age we were ordered to sit down, though there was barely any space\nin the little strip-lit hallway to do so. Eventually a senior officer began dragging people to\ntheir feet, sending them back out though the gauntlet one by one and into the night, where we\nwere immediately jumped on by more police officers - this time with riot shields - and\nshepherded into a waiting green truck belonging to Egypt's central security forces. The steps\nup to it were small and rickety, whilst the entranceway to the rear body of the truck -\npressed into use as a portable metal prison - was barely wide enough to accommodate a single\nperson at a time. A policeman smashed my head against the doorframe as I entered; inside\ndozens of protesters were already crammed in and crouching in the darkness. Some had heard the\nofficers count us as we boarded; our number stood at 44, all packed into a space barely any\nbigger than the back of a Transit van. A heavy metal door swung shut and locked behind\nus.<br />\n<br />\nInside, conditions were horrendous. As the truck began to move, brief flashes of orange\nstreetlight streamed through the thick metal grates on each side; with no windows, it was our\nonly source of illumination. With each glimmer, bruised and bloodied faces were revealed; we\nwere sandwiched in so tightly that the temperature quickly soared, and a number of people\nfainted. Snatched fragments of conversation began drifting through the truck, as the inmates\nexchanged anecdotes.<br />\n<br />\n\"The police attacked us to get us out of the square; they didn't care who you were, they just\nattacked everybody,\" explained the man next to me breathlessly, who turned out to be a lawyer\nnamed Ahmed Mamdouh. \"They took everybody's wallet and cell phones and they hit our heads and\nhurt some people. There are some people bleeding, and we don't know where they're taking us. I\nwant to send a message to my wife; I'm not afraid but she will be so scared, this is my first\nprotest and she told me not to come here today.\"<br />\n<br />\nDespite the demeaning violence meted out to all those in the truck, the protesters held\ntogether with remarkable strength and solidarity; those who collapsed were quickly helped to\ntheir feet, messages of support were whispered and then yelled from one end of our metallic\njail to another, and when it emerged that a couple of people had managed to hide their mobiles\nfrom the police the phones were quickly passed around so that as many as possible could call\ntheir loved ones. \"As I was being dragged in a police general said to me: 'Do you think you\ncan change the world? You can't! Do you think you are a hero? You are not',\" confided Mamdouh.\n\"What you see here - this brutality and torture - this is why we were protesting today,\" added\nanother voice close by in the gloom.<br />\n<br />\nDenied anything but scattergun glimpses of the outside world through the grates, speculation\nwas rife about where we were heading. The truck veered wildly round corners, sending us all\nflying to one side, and regularly came to an emergency stop, throwing everyone forwards. \"They\ntreat us like we're not Egyptians, like we are their enemy, just because we are fighting for\njobs,\" said Mamdouh through gritted teeth. I asked him what it felt like to be considered an\nenemy by your own government. \"I feel like they are my enemies too,\" he replied.<br />\n<br />\nAt several points the truck roared to a stop and the single door would clank open, revealing\narmed policemen on the other side. They called out the name of one of the protesters, 'Nour' -\nthe son of Ayman Nour, a prominent political dissident who challenged Hosni Mubarak for the\npresidency in 2005 and was promptly thrown in jail for his troubles. Nour became a cause\ncelebre amongst international politicians and pressure groups; since his release from prison\nEgypt's security forces have tried to avoid attacking him or his family directly, conscious of\nthe negative publicity that would inevitably follow.<br />\n<br />\nHis son, a respected political activist in his own right, had been caught in the police sweep\nand was in the back of the truck with us - now the policemen were demanding he come forward,\nas they had orders for his release. \"No, I'm staying,\" said Nour simply, over and over again\nand to thunderous applause from the rest of the inmates. I made my way through the throng and\nasked him why he wasn't taking up the chance to get out. \"Because either I leave with everyone\nelse or I stay with everyone else; it would be cowardice to do anything else,\" he responded.\n\"That's just the way I was raised.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter several meandering circles which seemed to take us out further and further into the\ndesert fringes of the city, the truck finally shuddered to a halt. We had been trapped inside\nfor so long that the heat was unbearable; more people had fainted, and one man was now\ncollapsed completely on the floor, struggling for breath. By the light of the few mobile\nphones that had made it into the truck, protesters tore his shirt open and tried to steady his\nbreathing; one demonstrator had medical experience and warned that the man was entering a\ndiabetic coma. A huge cry went up inside the truck as protesters began thumping the sides and\nbellowing through the grates: \"Help, a man is dying.\" There was no response.<br />\n<br />\nAfter some time a commotion could be heard outside; fighting appeared to be breaking out\nbetween police and others whom we couldn't make out. At one point the whole truck began to\nrock alarmingly from side to side whilst figures, hidden from view through the grates, began\nbanging the metal exterior, sending huge metallic clangs echoing round our ears as we clung on\nfor dear life. We could make out that a struggle was taking place over the opening of the\ndoor; none of the protesters had any idea what lay on the other side, but all resolved to\ncharge at it whenever the door yawned open. Eventually it did so, to reveal a police officer\nwho began to grab inmates and haul them out, beating them as they went. A cry went up and we\nsurged forward, sending the policeman flying; the diabetic man was then carried out carefully\nby protesters before the rest of us spilled gleefully onto the streets.<br />\n<br />\nLater it emerged that we had won our freedom through the efforts of Nour's parents, Ayman and\nhis former wife Gamila Ismail, who had followed the truck at breakneck speed and fought with\nofficers for our release. Shorn of money and phones and stranded several miles into the\ndesert, the protesters began a long trudge back towards Cairo, hailing down cars on the way.\nMost said that they would be back on the streets again in the morning. \"They beat the fear out\nof me,\" said Mohamed Abo Awad, a 21 year old. The diabetic patient was swiftly loaded into a\nvehicle and taken to hospital; I've been unable to find out his condition since.<br />\n<br />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"], ["riots in the hood | Pie in the Sky", "http://murphmick.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/riots-in-the-hood/", "Pie in the Sky", "http://murphmick.wordpress.com", "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>I absolutely love the neighborhood I live in here in Berlin, but it is known for the left\nside views and frequent demonstrations that can be found here.

All trams were down, and the demonstrators\nwere actually marching straight down the tram tracks. From a distance, you could hear what\nsounded like gun shots, and their constant shouts. The police were everywhere, with gas masks\nand all their other riot gear. As the crowd approached, we tried to see if it was just an\nanti-fascist group or what - but as they passed it seemed like it was more of an anti-police\ngroup? shouting things like \"Whose streets? Our streets!\"</p>\n<p>As it turns out, one of the few squats left standing here in Berlin- Liebigstra?e 14, was\nbeing officially kicked out on Wednesday morning by the police. <a\ntitle=\"http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110202-32817.html\"\nhref=\"http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110202-32817.html\" target=\"_blank\">(news article)</a>\nIt turns out that protests has begun on the weekend, and carried on through the week.\nWednesday is my day to go in late to work, but I ran into hordes of police and protesters at\nthe train station I take.</p>\n<p>At 7 o'clock, the same evening - I could tell they were all rallying for round right around\nthe corner from me. I went over to Boxhagener Platz to check it out. There were police\neverywhere and protesters were dressed in all black. I was standing by a single-file line of\nmaybe 40 police ready with riot gear and guns. They followed the crowd as it began and i\nfollowed shortly after. It didn't seem violent at first, and the protesters just began\nchanting and marching down the road. I made it back to my apartment, and then just watched for\na solid 10 minutes while people paraded down my road. When I was at the park, I couldn't tell\nhow far back the crowds went, but now they seemed to go forever, taking up the width of the\nwhole road. <a title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyEBuqCrlEA\"\nhref=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyEBuqCrlEA\" target=\"_blank\">(short but dark\nvideo)</a></p>\n<p>Eventually, they stopped a couple blocks away, and things became much more violent. Bottles\nwere thrown in every direction and the windows of local businesses were smashed to bits. Some\n2,000 cops were deployed for the day to deal with it, and it seemed to carry on for hours. We\ncould hear the helicopters and fireworks continuing for quite some time from home - and even\nat 2 in the morning there were still Police lights up and down the street. A coworker and\nfriend of mine was caught driving through the mess - leaving her car with several new bottle\ndents from the night.</p>\n<p>I've walked home a few different ways this week, and the stream of broken and smashed\nwindows does not seem to end. As much as I believe in keeping rents down, supporting the\nculture of the city, and keeping these amazing squats alive - the way things went down was\ncompletely unnecessary. I love the atmosphere for the punk - hippie - left wing feel of my\nneighborhood, but its true that most people who joined the protest were more interested in\njust fighting back than for standing up for a belief.</p>\n<p>but - I guess its just another day in Berlin? and i still love it.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#993366;\">tune of the day: like janis by rodriguez</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both\"><br />\n</div>\n</div>"], ["In Whom We Have Redemption: Talk about great timing!", "http://inwhomwehaveredemption.blogspot.com/2011/03/talk-about-great-timing.html", "In Whom We Have Redemption", "http://inwhomwehaveredemption.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>\n<div class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cLNmpW2-DWo/TXtpY6lSBtI/AAAAAAAAA9Y/G0bi1Zi1VdQ/s1600/varazdin3-738538.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5583172039819265746\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cLNmpW2-DWo/TXtpY6lSBtI/AAAAAAAAA9Y/G0bi1Zi1VdQ/s400/varazdin3-738538.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9NxXFzNthVU/TXtpZdOrlJI/AAAAAAAAA9g/LWeSzx-QCpY/s1600/Varazdin1-740681.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5583172049119712402\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9NxXFzNthVU/TXtpZdOrlJI/AAAAAAAAA9g/LWeSzx-QCpY/s400/Varazdin1-740681.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-k4l-vrO60/TXtpZ6RbjnI/AAAAAAAAA9o/yZLcUNmqjc8/s1600/Varazdin2-742881.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5583172056915873394\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-k4l-vrO60/TXtpZ6RbjnI/AAAAAAAAA9o/yZLcUNmqjc8/s400/Varazdin2-742881.jpg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\nToday, as we were in Vara?din witnessing in the town square we noticed a large number of\npolice on every street, including special police forces in riot gear.<br />\nAfter questioning a few locals about what was going on, we were told that another\nanti-government protest would be taking place in about 45 minutes.<br />\nThankfully, I had my gospel signs in the car and could retrieve them in time for all the\nprotesters to have an opportunity to read a few verses of Scripture.<br />\nMy friend, Alen Dubravec, was with me and he was glad to have the opportunity also.<br />\nWe don't know how many people were there, but we do know they all had a chance to read \"Only\nJesus Saves.

There were people from many\ndifferent trades unions and community groups. We marched over Waterloo Bridge, down one side\nof the river, back over the next bridge, back up the river and down to Westminster, then down\nWhitehall. My friend and I left the March at Trafalgar Square as it was already 4 o'clock and\nby the time we had got to Hyde Park where the march finished, the speeches would have been\nover and we would have then had to make our way back to Covent Garden where we were going out.\nSo we dipped out and headed off for some food. I am glad I went though as it is a worthwhile\nthing to be protesting against-the cuts the government are making to public sector services\nwill have the most impact on those people with the least.</div>\n<br />\n<div><a\nhref=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/25/public-sector-cuts-where-will-they-hit?intcmp=239\">\nPublic Sector cuts-where they will hit</a></div>\n<br />\n<div>The atmosphere of the march was cheerful and peaceful from all that I saw. There was some\nmusic from various sound systems, people with random instruments, and a little pipe band (I\ndon't know who they were but they sounded good!) People were friendly and conversing with\nstrangers. I was offered a Socialist Worker magazine by a very polite and smiling young man\nand when I said no thank you he continued to smile. So, it is galling that a small minority of\npeople choose to use violence for their own ends and that the media choose to focus on that.\nThere is always this element of violence at these big demos and it is always said to be\nAnarchists. I have been reading a long and fascinating wikipedia article on <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism\">Anarchism</a> this morning as my knowledge is\npatchy. I can't say whether these modern day violent protesters are Anarchists or not, or\nwhether they believe that what they are doing will make a difference to society. I do feel\nthat there might well be those who just like a fight. Anarchism seems to be such a diverse\nmovement with many ways of being, and violent protest is one. There was one part of the\narticle that summed up how I feel about the way the media coverage just likes to focus on the\nviolence though. It is in the part about contemporary Anarchism.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>\"Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part\nof the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.[103] Anarchists became\nknown for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), Group of Eight, and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests\nengaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the\nconfrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These\nactions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as black blocs; other\norganisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups and\nthe use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period\nwas the confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999.\"</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>The last few photos are the window of The Salisbury on St. Martin's lane where we went to\ncelebrate my friend Clare's birthday. When we left and walked down to Charing Cross we saw one\nof the fires the papers talked about. We also saw a cyclist fall off their bike and two police\nofficers rush to help him get up. The helicopters were hovering over us all night.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>Happy birthday to Claire Birch if you are reading. Your card sat in my bag all day so has\nbeen on the demo-but I forgot to post it! Louise and Paul were on the march and we saw them in\nthe pub too!</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"], ["Howard Hardiman: 26th March Protests Across London: Why are windows and the olympic clock more important than people?", "http://zombiecoterie.blogspot.com/2011/03/26th-march-protests-across-london-why.html", "The Coterie of Zombies: The Not so Cute and Not so Sad Blog", "http://zombiecoterie.blogspot.com", "<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-3288267176617924592'>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><i><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hJu3C3sqv5k/TY8KjC4_VuI/AAAAAAAACHY/QupH0uHmpzM/s1600/IMG_1519.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hJu3C3sqv5k/TY8KjC4_VuI/AAAAAAAACHY/QupH0uHmpzM/s640/IMG_1519.jpg\"\nwidth=\"476\" /></a></i></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><i>The Trojan Horse of the\nApocalypse and the Big Society on Westminster Bridge.</i></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">Well, yesterday was the big <a\nhref=\"http://marchforthealternative.org.uk/\">march for the alternative</a> which I almost made\nmyself late for by <a\nhref=\"http://zombiecoterie.blogspot.com/2011/03/no-hesitation-no-deviation-no.html\">blogging\nabout</a> before leaving the flat. As I mentioned in that, I was worried about being kettled\nby the police and having all manner of weird health problems, not to mention the risk of being\nhit, so I packed a bag full of food and drink, a scarf that could be used as a picnic blanket\na nice warm hat as well as a medic alert bracelet and spare medication, just in case I needed\nto talk to medical staff about why I'd need to leave - although I'd decided that if I was\ntrapped in, I was staying in, not playing a get-out-of-kettle-free card.</div>\n<a id=\"more\" name='more'></a><br />\n<br />\nI got to Kennington at eleven to meet a group of people and while they assembled, chatted to\nstrangers and gave directions to the park to a range of families, sweet old ladies, people\nwho'd travelled in from very far out of London and a fairly noticeable contingent of young\npeople who'd come in hoods and face scarves that matched my picnic-scarf, but with the idea of\nkeeping their identity away from the police who were already filming people even as we were\njust gathering outside of Oval station. The presumption of innocence seems to be a thing of\nthe past.<br />\n<br />\nIn the park, there was a really friendly mix of people (I have the sense I'm going to be\nrepeating that again and again, but it bears emphasis). I got a few texts from friends asking\nwhere we might meet and when I'd said I was at Kennington, a couple replied that they'd heard\nit was where the big Anarchist lot were starting from, so I should be cautious. That might\nexplain why the police were filming things, if their intelligence had picked up the same thing\nthat friends of mine had heard, so there's a bit of common sense to it.<br />\n<br />\nAs we started moving off, the chatter was chirpy, mostly people surprised at the enormity of\nthe march we were on and how this was just a small feeder march that the Police had tried to\ndiscourage, saying that it had seemed unnecessary to them (according to one person with a\nmegaphone, anyway, I suspect this might have just been hubris) and people just really enjoying\nthe wit of the banners, and those without them taking the ones handed out by Socialist Worker\npeople, berating them for using bleached card, then tearing out the part that said \"Socialist\nWorker\" so they could just keep the slogan.<br />\n<br />\nThe horse was amazing. It was one of four horses of the apocalypse, but was the most\nimpressive, and I think it was built at Camberwell, but I might be mistaken. If so, I'm proud.\nEither way, it was one of the things that gave the march a sense of procession and carnival\nthat really focused the point around bringing people together rather than the horrible\npolitics of division that we're relentlessly exposed to at the moment.<br />\n<br />\nAs the march got to Lambeth North, we were told to turn and cross at Blackfriars Bridge, not\nWestminster, with the argument being that we'd be detained if we kept to the original route,\nbut the bulk of the march refused this and although the vanguard of the march (which I was in)\nhad been moved around by the police and the TUC stewards, so we dashed back to join the main\nbody as they stuck to the plan and pressed on towards Parliament.<br />\n<br />\nThere, the anarchists in hoods and scarves started shouting \"Oh, 'cause standing around's\ngoing to cause a revolution? 'being polite's going to change a fucking thing? The police want\nyou to turn left, oh, I mean right, um so you go right?\" and everyone giggled. The megaphone\nwent quiet after that.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zTFPZX2ayY/TY8LCddtllI/AAAAAAAACII/SaxwiafMukU/s1600/IMG_1531.JPG\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"320\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zTFPZX2ayY/TY8LCddtllI/AAAAAAAACII/SaxwiafMukU/s320/IMG_1531.JPG\"\nwidth=\"320\" /></a></div>\nBy the time we were coming up to Trafalgar Square, the reported numbers were ranging from\n250,000 to half a million people. I think that the counting point was along Embankment, so by\ncrossing Westminster Bridge, the tens of thousands who came up from Kennington were not\ncounted, and I wonder how many other feeder marches missed whichever counting point was used.\nThere might be another counting method used, based on helicopter images and an assumption of\nthree people per square metre, which is where I guess the half-million would come from, but by\nhalf twelve, when I was approaching Trafalgar Square, people were already solid from Hyde Park\nCorner all the way along the route along to Trafalgar Square (which was full), down Whitehall\nto Parliament Square, along the Embankment as far as opposite the National Theatre on the\nNorth Side and as far back as Lambeth North to the South. However many square metres that is\nin people, I don't think it really matters, but it's a lot of people, and that's not including\nthe UK Uncut groups gathering in Soho as they prepared for the occupations in Oxford Street\nand Piccadilly.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rIaEDE1Tk5Y/TY8LFi3TIGI/AAAAAAAACIQ/CXGdZuqCVds/s1600/IMG_1533.JPG\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rIaEDE1Tk5Y/TY8LFi3TIGI/AAAAAAAACIQ/CXGdZuqCVds/s320/IMG_1533.JPG\"\nwidth=\"320\" /></a></div>\nWhat was really stirring about the march was the diversity of it; you had pensioners' groups\nmarching next to families who were broken-hearted about the cuts to Sure Start services, you\nhad Disabled People Against The Cuts next to youth sports groups.

There was a Sky News camera crew just next to them,\nand the pair disappeared from the march just afterwards.<br />\n<br />\nNow, I don't want to be suspicious or anything, but I also heard of people being offered money\nfrom reporters to throw bricks at windows (?25 was the going rate, allegedly), so the fact\nthat the reporters just happened to be exactly at the perfect spots to get the perfect shots\nmight not be entirely coincidence when those photos get them the front pages to net the\noutraged front pages.<br />\n<br />\nThe march was overwhelmingly, and I mean that in the sense that it was stirringly and\nheart-warmingly, peaceful and friendly. The chances of the reporters knowing to be at the\nexact spots where the 16 people who, during the day, engaged in criminal activity resulting in\narrest out of a crowd of 500,000 beggars belief, frankly.<br />\n<br />\nI mean, look - is this a bunch of mindless yobs intent on destroying London and\nLondoners?<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sIQ8vPc074s/TY8LTsTsDDI/AAAAAAAACIo/x2MHIM5j_g0/s1600/IMG_1539.JPG\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\"\nsrc=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sIQ8vPc074s/TY8LTsTsDDI/AAAAAAAACIo/x2MHIM5j_g0/s320/IMG_1539.JPG\"\nwidth=\"320\" /></a></div>\nNo, it's a fucking enormous number of people in Hyde Park, milling around, chatting and being\na bit twee, trying to put the world to rights over a picnic.

In the centre of Oxford Circus,\nthere were the ashes from where the giant horse had been broken down and burned - now, I'm not\nsure if this was a genuine Trojan Horse to use as a weapon, or just because it was cold and\npeople needed to warm up when they were being held without charge for hours and had no access\nto food, water or somewhere to go to the toilet.<br />\n<br />\nGenerally, though, the policing that I experienced, was very low-key, friendly and polite -\nthe Met police were a little cowed, even, as though ashamed about how things had gone down in\nthe past. One guy caught himself cruising me, we laughed at each other, then his role forced\nitself around him again like armour and he couldn't meet my eye as he became a policeman\nagain, but the reminder that it's people who are generally motivated by a desire to do a job\nthat involves a social conscience and a connection with people (maybe not just cruising\nprotesters, admittedly) was important.<br />\n<br />\nI have to admit, I'm confused by the attack on Fortnum and Masons, who give a large amount of\ntheir income to charitable ventures in the arts, education and other areas and have quite a\nclear <a href=\"http://www.fortnumandmason.com/corporate-responsibility.aspx\">corporate social\nresponsibility</a> policy which would, in my eye, imply they're taking from the rich and\ngiving to the poor, but I'll freely admit to not knowing the full picture, and the UK Uncut\npeople generally do their homework before picking their targets, so I'm not going to let my\nlove of fancy cheese colour my opinion too much before I worry about it being a class war\naction rather than something more clearly about closing tax inequality.<br />\n<br />\nTrafalgar Square was a party. We went there and there were people drumming and playing music\nand dancing around. It was a laugh. People were chatting to the police and drawing in chalk on\nthe pavement outside the National Gallery. It was a party, and the people there were having\nfun and relaxing after a nice day. There was still stuff happening in Piccadilly, but the\npeople in Trafalgar Square weren't the people who'd set out to smash things, they were there\nto dance around and have a laugh.<br />\n<br />\nWe left with a smile on our faces and even commented that the police had been really\nrelaxed.<br />\n<br />\nOn the train back, I heard from other friends that I'd just missed madness. Someone had tried\nto put a sticker on the Olympic Clock, the police had tried to stop him, his friends pulled\nhim away, the police arrested him and hit some of his friends, then released him, while others\nrallied around and shouted at them for being unreasonable - a couple of people threw their\nwater bottles, by which point the riot police had been radioed in. The police by the Olympic\nClock released the man and things eased off, but the riot team came in hard and attacked\npeople, including an unarmed teenage girl who was already crying when she was hit, so the\npeople who had been drinking and dancing fought to protect the people being attacked and it\nturned into a major situation, all because one man tried to put a sticker on the Olympic\nClock.<br />\n<br />\nThe news reported it as a hard core of violent protesters intent on causing property damage\nthrowing missiles at police officers.

In this context the\nfact that some of the press and TV coverage may not have accurately reported what happened is\narguably less significant.<br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>'Millionaire Boys Club' - 'Tax is for the little people':</em></p>\n<br />\n<p><a\nhref=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aAsX3KwihSE/TZWCIn__aRI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/awR0VE1FnsM/s1600/demo22.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 228px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 400px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517597138282770\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aAsX3KwihSE/TZWCIn__aRI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/awR0VE1FnsM/s400/demo22.JPG\" /></a>\n<a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IWj8udjRdtc/TZWCIdgpSSI/AAAAAAAAAFI/RLKYvjj-EVM/s1600/100_9108.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 300px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517594322454818\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IWj8udjRdtc/TZWCIdgpSSI/AAAAAAAAAFI/RLKYvjj-EVM/s400/100_9108.JPG\" /></a>\n<a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bi2B79k-Xk0/TZWCIdeyE6I/AAAAAAAAAFA/Uyq28ycAO9A/s1600/demo19.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 300px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517594314642338\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bi2B79k-Xk0/TZWCIdeyE6I/AAAAAAAAAFA/Uyq28ycAO9A/s400/demo19.JPG\" /></a></p>\n<br />\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Trafalgar Square - 'Strike like an Egyptian':</em></p>\n<a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CFo8hysa4Fc/TZWBvwJ7qLI/AAAAAAAAAE4/Cdhxf5n2F3I/s1600/demo21.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 272px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517169830734002\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CFo8hysa4Fc/TZWBvwJ7qLI/AAAAAAAAAE4/Cdhxf5n2F3I/s400/demo21.JPG\" /></a>\n<a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ytu7o-D5CwI/TZWBv0xJieI/AAAAAAAAAEw/xvOc1xoUQBY/s1600/demo12.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 300px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 400px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517171068963298\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ytu7o-D5CwI/TZWBv0xJieI/AAAAAAAAAEw/xvOc1xoUQBY/s400/demo12.JPG\" /></a><br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Kkl27TT7lBU/TZWBv7NPuJI/AAAAAAAAAEo/YMf4dx36GlQ/s1600/100_9102.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 300px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517172797421714\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Kkl27TT7lBU/TZWBv7NPuJI/AAAAAAAAAEo/YMf4dx36GlQ/s400/100_9102.JPG\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yf6yXAvnMJI/TZWBvQDTRgI/AAAAAAAAAEg/oKKQ3pASICQ/s1600/demo14.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 300px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517161212986882\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yf6yXAvnMJI/TZWBvQDTRgI/AAAAAAAAAEg/oKKQ3pASICQ/s400/demo14.JPG\" /></a><br />\n<div><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4uiNAUhuJZE/TZWBvQlKqRI/AAAAAAAAAEY/QyOlE5KlzGk/s1600/demo16.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 400px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 300px; CURSOR: hand\"\nid=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590517161355028754\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4uiNAUhuJZE/TZWBvQlKqRI/AAAAAAAAAEY/QyOlE5KlzGk/s400/demo16.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div>Much of the commentary since the march has focused on a supposed distinction between the\npeaceful main demonstration, the non-violent direct action of UK Uncut (including the\noccupation of posh food store, <span id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_6\"\nclass=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Fortnum</span> and Masons in Piccadilly) and riotous 'Black Bloc'\nanarchists.

A sense of the of its magnitude could be found at the service stop, which was\nbustling with people of all ages; trade unionists, socialists, students and families. Owen, a\nstudent form Bournemouth University, summed up why he, and the vast majority of the hundreds\nof thousands descending on London were marching, to me on the bus.\"I'm marching against a\nwhole host of unnecessary cuts which are going to hit the poorest in society the hardest.\" On\nthe streets of London that view was clear on every sign, placard and flag that made up the\nvibrant sea of the half a million people who brought central London to a standstill. It took\nsome time to enter that sea as we were directed around the city streets, to avoid the real\npossibility of a crush, before we could join the march on The Embankment. With every Trade\nUnion represented, as well as various political groups and parties, and ordinary people who\nsaw the sense of injustice in the cuts being made to ordinary people's services by a Cabinet\nof millionaires, this was the most diverse protest I had ever been on. It was so extraordinary\nthat in the four hours we marched, I did not get as far as Trafalgar Square, showing the\nmagnitude of the march, which to many on the streets seemed to be on the same scale as that\nanti-war march eight years ago. Indeed as the speeches began in Hyde Park, people were still\nmoving off to march from The Embankment. The pace was slow, the atmosphere electric but\npeaceful. The anger however was present for all to see. With chants calling for 'no public\nservice cuts' and labelling Nick Clegg as 'a fucking Tory too' as well as calling to 'burn the\nfucking lot' - Tories and Lib Dems- this was not simply the passive signature symbol of\n'democracy' that the Government had hoped for. And this anger was present across London, in a\ndifferent way, around Oxford Street and the West End, where UK Uncut targeted the usual tax\nevaders of Vodafone and Topshop, as well as a new secret target, Fortnum and Masons. Here\naround 150 protesters peacefully occupied the luxury food store to raise awareness of what\nthey say is a ?10 million, annual unpaid tax bill. As the media showed pictures of The Ritz\nbeing attacked and cash points and police being covered in paint, 145 of those peacefully\noccupying the store were arrested. Around three quarters of the 200 arrested overall on the\nday, and not the 'violent anarchists' whose blood much of the media were baying for. We may\nhave missed the official speeches in Hyde Park, due solely to the scale of the march, but the\nprotest was far from over. As we ventured to Trafalgar Square it was beginning to fill up with\nprotesters wishing to turn it into Tahir Square in solidarity with the Egyptian revolution and\nas a symbol of the power of ordinary people. Bahrain flags were present amongst the banners\ncalling for a general strike, while placards read 'Hands off Libya'. The atmosphere was\nparty-like, with samba bands and boom boxes blasting out music, be it dubstep or 'killing in\nthe name' to the several thousand protesters. People listened to speeches from Labour MP John\nMcDonnell and eyewitnesses to the events in Cairo, while others danced around fires lit to\nkeep warm. (With their own placards and not public property). Discussions were taking place\nabout the next steps in the fight against cuts, and controlled fireworks were released into\nthe night sky. The peaceful atmosphere changed as police in full riot gear surged into the\ncrowd, batons were coming down on protesters and those who sat down to show they did not wish\nto fight back were trampled upon. 'The battle of Trafalgar Square'', as some media outlets\nlabelled it, was not so much a battle as an attack on a peaceful demonstration in a public\nplace. The sort of attacks our politicians spoke out against (eventually) when they happened\nin Cairo and Tunis - with batons and shields instead of guns and knives - were taking place on\nstreets of London. By midnight most people had been forced out of the square and its perimeter\nwas secured by Police. But some 20-30 people remained kettled around Nelson's Column. The\nattitude of the police and press alike was summed up as I broke through the police lines to\ntake photos and find out what was happening. An officer told me if I did not get back I would\nbe arrested with those on the column. I asked on what grounds were they to be arrested? He\nreplied, \"we haven't decided yet\". I made a Sky News team present aware of this but they\nshowed little concern and simply filmed riot clad police pushing peaceful , unarmed protesters\noff Nelson's Column before arresting them to 'prevent a breach of the peace'. I did not see\nthis footage on the news.</div>"], ["A Journalism Journey: My Time With The Blac Block On Saturday The 26th", "http://will-cooper123.blogspot.com/2011/04/my-time-with-blac-block-on-saturday.html", "A Journalism Journey", "http://will-cooper123.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-2270642984632267790'>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">I first experienced the Black Bloc on the\n26th when waiting outside Embankment station, stood just under the Millenium Bridge.

Despite this and despite\nattempts to redirect protests we were able to get to the side of the Presidential Palace.\nHowever, the next day they had decided that we could not march as planned and brought a few\nhundred police against a crowd of a similar size. (With even more police ready in nearby vans\njust in case.) People were able to observe snipers on nearby rooftops.<br />\n<a id=\"more\" href=\"\" name=\"more\"></a><br />\n<br />\nNot only did the police come ready with tear gas, but also we saw the Polish premiere of the\nLRAD - Long Range Accustic Device which is used to direct tortuous noise onto demonstrators to\ndisperse crowds.

This is not something I ever thought I'd\nsay.<br />\n<br />\nAs I left my home office at the back of the house at about 6pm this evening I was surprised to\nnotice the number of people lingering outside in the normally quiet side-street in which I\nlive. Looking down the street I was shocked to see police in riot gear.<br />\n<br />\nThe scenes that followed were not pretty. The police were significantly outnumbered by the\npeople on the street, who looked young, included many black men - and white men and women,\ntoo. They started to seek out items they could throw - the local dustbins, wheely bins, items\nfrom front gardens (including mine).<br />\n<br />\nMost of the projectiles were aimed at the police. Soon, though, the small number of cars\nparked on the streets became targets. First one window was broken. Then another. Over time the\ncars went from being a side show to becoming the main attraction as it became increasingly\nclear that there was a determination amongst the rioters to set them alight. Soon they had\nsucceeded and, given the fire hazard, it was time for the rioters to move on.<br />\n<br />\nFor a while I sat indoors wondering if it was safe to be in the rooms overlooking the street.\nThen I ventured out to ask the police if it was safe to pop down the road for some food and\nfresh air. They encouraged me to stay safely at home, in case the rioters returned. As I\nreturned home, two young men were in front of my gate and I asked if I could come through and\nencouraged them to get away from the proximity of the still burning cars. We got\ntalking.<br />\n<br />\nWere you involved this evening? I asked. Now, not us, we're good boys. We're just covering up\nour faces because we don't want to risk losing our jobs if we're seen. But they (pointing to\nthe police) - they've got to understand that if they keep taking our jobs away, we're going to\ndo something - they've got to understand.<br />\n<br />\nWhen they announced there were riots in Lewisham on the 7pm news bulletin I knew to give my\nMum a ring and to pop a status update on Facebook. People have been leaving messages all\nevening and the phone has not stopped ringing. It's a touching reminder of the love people\nhave for me. As the evening has unfolded I have been watching the BBC 24-hour news of riots in\nLewisham, Peckham, Hackney, Croydon, Birmingham.<br />\n<br />\nThe phrase \"mindless thugs\" has been used so many times. The risk is clear. Young people\ncrying out to be heard are dismissed by the simple use of a label. And because they are not\nbeing heard, they shout louder. The police, seeking to do the best for their community, are\nalso not being heard. Neither side is able to see beyond the label - \"police\", \"rioters\",\n\"thugs\"... with each new label we become a little less human in each others' eyes.<br />\n<br />\nI want to be clear. I do not favour the kind of action these young people took this evening\nand I want them to be held accountable. At the same time, I want them to be heard. It seems to\nme that this is a time for sorting the wheat from the chaff, until we have stripped away the\nacts of mindless destruction - perhaps even the violence on both sides - to understand the\nreal concerns on all sides.<br />\n<br />\nFor me, though, right now, it's time to sleep. My dreams cannot be any stranger than the\nreality of this evening's events.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n</div>"], ["A day in the life of....: Unrest in Eltham.", "http://michaelsnasdell.blogspot.com/2011/08/unrest-in-eltham.html", "A day in the life of....", "http://michaelsnasdell.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-4125288173901672551'>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ghPFvFhseHc/TkHD9ui6ydI/AAAAAAAAASw/4PNK04tjbKA/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU1LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-753541\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ghPFvFhseHc/TkHD9ui6ydI/AAAAAAAAASw/4PNK04tjbKA/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU1LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-753541\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003673678498258\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Of9MVbW21-c/TkHD-AoyQKI/AAAAAAAAAS4/UML92qbcJNE/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU3LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-755708\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Of9MVbW21-c/TkHD-AoyQKI/AAAAAAAAAS4/UML92qbcJNE/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU3LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-755708\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003678534942882\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3U6TKzwBbTg/TkHD-7_XioI/AAAAAAAAATA/qMZUCziM_kM/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU5LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-757979\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3U6TKzwBbTg/TkHD-7_XioI/AAAAAAAAATA/qMZUCziM_kM/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTU5LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-757979\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003694467353218\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LSLyNlREsLw/TkHD_XsaGRI/AAAAAAAAATI/Ww6nWx2TjDw/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYxLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-760262\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LSLyNlREsLw/TkHD_XsaGRI/AAAAAAAAATI/Ww6nWx2TjDw/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYxLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-760262\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003701904021778\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gjW0lPrbsns/TkHD_35eOKI/AAAAAAAAATQ/Bqn_qFlDxIk/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYyLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-762075\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gjW0lPrbsns/TkHD_35eOKI/AAAAAAAAATQ/Bqn_qFlDxIk/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYyLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-762075\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003710548752546\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xEC87J7cuzM/TkHEAK5S58I/AAAAAAAAATY/FmnOHZVbuAE/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYzLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-763798\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xEC87J7cuzM/TkHEAK5S58I/AAAAAAAAATY/FmnOHZVbuAE/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTYzLmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-763798\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003715648284610\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"mobile-photo\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fp71Y30do6Y/TkHEAmFR0_I/AAAAAAAAATg/_gdjJjf5Vzw/s1600/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTY1LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-765658\">\n<img\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fp71Y30do6Y/TkHEAmFR0_I/AAAAAAAAATg/_gdjJjf5Vzw/s320/%253D%253Futf-8%253FB%253FSU1HLTIwMTEwODA5LTAyOTY1LmpwZw%253D%253D%253F%253D-765658\"\nborder=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5639003722946302962\" /></a></p>\nTonight through various sources I was told that Eltham was experiencing some unrest. Reports\nof the EDL and Millwall fans taking to the streets to reclaim them, and 'defend' their town.\nQuite noble in some peoples eyes.\n<p>On arriving in the area at around 10pm it was immediately obvious something was happening.\nVery heavy traffic, numerous police vehicles in the queue, and dozens if not hundreds of young\nwhite men walking up the street with a spring in their step.</p>\n<p>Getting out of the car and joining the flocks of people, I started to walk up to the\njunction by McDonalds (for those who know the area). Instantly I felt like I didn't belong,\nand using my Blackberry to film the police passing on blues was not appreciated by the groups,\nshowing their disapproval by shouting \"he's filming, he's filming\". I stopped!</p>\n<p>Arriving at the junction I was greeted by about a dozen police vehicles, including a large\nnumber of riot officers from the vehicles. Hearing shouting and seeing movement I headed over,\njust in time to see the police moving in to take two men out of the crowd. The jeers of the\ncrowds went up \"we are The Eltham, we are the Millwall\".</p>\n<p>As the crowds became louder, I decided to seperate myself from them. Heading to one end of\nthe group I was faced with a wall of riot officers, walking to the other end I was greeted by\nthe same. Strangely intimidating looking, yet great to chat to. Leaving the containment was no\nproblem, and managed to exchange words. Hearing him explaining to someone he has had about 10\nhours off in 3 days. Poor sods!</p>\n<p>I wandered about for a few minutes longer, taking a few more of the attached shots before\nheading off. To round it up I would say the crowd was good spirited, yet due to the number of\npeople on the streets, and the potential of what could happen, the police were going nowhere\nfast. As I finally did move on I passed a police van stopped at the traffic lights, giving a\nyoung lad a piece of his mind. The cop concerned was already quite wired from a bit earlier.\nThe lad had thrown a pipe at the police van as it passed by. So he deserved everything he\ngot.</p>\n<p>The night ended in a slightly more lighthearted way. We went to Catford to grab some food,\nstopping at McDonalds. The same location of the JD Sport looting of the previous night.\nTonight there was a police presence there, but all was quiet. Police exercising stop and\nsearch, while a few more took a well earned break. Taking it in turns to walk through the\ndrive thru, and as pictured, some having a sit down at the table.</p>\n<p>It was nice to see nothing too serious happening in London tonight, but strange to see no\nmention of the numbers of police and youths in Eltham on the news.</p>\n<p>Thanks for following the blog, and reading.

Having rushed over from my apartment after seeing <a\nhref=\"http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution\">the live stream</a>, I got there just as the\ndemonstration had reached the southern end of the park. Hundreds of people who had walked two\nmiles from the Wall Street area were smiling and in good spirits. They were marching west.</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Day_8_WE_NEED_JOBS.jpg\"\nsrc=\"http://jameswagner.com/images/Day_8_WE_NEED_JOBS.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"\nclass=\"mt-image-none\" /><br />\nsince Union Square had been the objective of the march, when it arrived there the enormous\ncrowd had unavoidably begun to bunch up; some were still entering the park from the south,\nwalking across 14th Street, and their numbers had forced others to walk in the street</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p>The police didn't like that. They quickly became violent, ordering the marchers to do what\nin fact couldn't be done and be where they couldn't be. Without waiting they started\nassaulting the peaceful people and some bystanders, seemingly at random. Most of the rage and\nbrutality came from the higher-ranking officers (the white shirts); it was clear at the time,\nand even more clear in the still and video images which record what happened, that many of the\nbeat cops appeared to be shocked at what they were being told to do but perhaps more terrified\nof the anger of their superior officers.</p>\n<p>The NYPD had unrolled their hated contemptible plastic netting and were using it to\nseparate the march into segments, and/or arrest any poor soul unlucky enough to be caught in\nthe traps. People immediately panicked, screamed, and yelled (a totally natural response to\nsuch an assault and outrage), and that only further inflamed the cops, and the senior officers\nin particular.</p>\n<p>I was trapped for a moment myself, but in an almost Keystone Cops melodramatic turn I\nspotted an open parking garage door and, with at least one other panicked refugee from the\nstreet roundup, ran into the building. Expecting to be pursued even inside, I started to run\nup a ramp to another level when I noticed another wide entrance opening to the side street to\nthe west. My companion and I both slipped out of it just seconds before the attendant\nsucceeded in closing the heavy overhead door. He may have been panicked himself by the\nviolence going outside and was apparently notinterested in allowing the garage to become any\nkind of refuge.</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Day_8_University_Place.jpg\"\nsrc=\"http://jameswagner.com/images/Day_8_University_Place.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"\nclass=\"mt-image-none\" /><br />\neven after the disturbing events on 14th Street, a section of the march proceded peacefully\ndown University Place, where most of its participants tried to remain on a sidewalk much too\nnarrow even for their reduced number; the police however were more interested in unrolling\ntheir nets once more (here at 12th Street), and again shutting down the street entirely, than\nseeing the march continue on its way downtown without incident or major disruptions</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Day_8_getting_names.jpg\"\nsrc=\"http://jameswagner.com/images/Day_8_getting_names.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"\nclass=\"mt-image-none\" /><br />\nthe police once again attacked the crowd violently at the intersection of 12th Street and\nUniversity Place sometimes pulling their victims from the crowd, throwing or flipping them to\nthe ground, binding their arms behind their backs with plastic cuffs, arresting them, and in\nseveral instances, macing them; support people, both trained and drafted on the spot, recorded\nthe names of the arrestees when they were able to do so</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Day_8_NYPD_weir.jpg\" src=\"http://jameswagner.com/images/Day_8_NYPD_weir.jpg\"\nwidth=\"600\" height=\"399\" class=\"mt-image-none\" /><br />\nthe NYPD's monstrous system of weirs, birthed during the 2004 Republican National Convention,\nwas as confusing to its potential victims as it was feared: No one knew where it would end up\nwhen it was first displayed, and of course no one wanted to end up like a trapped animal</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Day_8_West_12_St_NYPD_blockade.jpg\"\nsrc=\"http://jameswagner.com/images/Day_8_West_12_St_NYPD_blockade.jpg\" width=\"600\"\nheight=\"399\" class=\"mt-image-none\" /><br />\nif anyone was blocking pedestrian and motor traffic for other than a few moments, it was the\nNYPD, which locked down the streets below Union Square for what must have been a couple of\nhours; as usual, their self-directed assignment was, by their own admission, if not in these\nexact words, to keep a peaceful assembly of New Yorkers from interfering with the passage of\nvehicles to which their streets have been sacrificed</p>\n<p><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"more\" class=\"asset-more\">\n<p>I was standing at the intersection of University Place and 12th Street when several of the\nmost brutal police assaults occurred. I was at least a dozen feet from the curb, trying to\nrecord the repeated lunges and batterings by what looked to me like blue and white uniforms\ngone mad, when I was suddenly shoved violently by what must have been a bruiser of a cop,\nsince I'm not small myself: I nearly fell, while impulsively shielding my camera, but a number\nof others behind me actually hit the ground. It came out of nowhere, so I can't describe our\nassailant or assailants, but I wouldn't be surprised if, since many of the victims of the\nattack had been pointing cameras at the appalling scene in front of them, \"citizen\njournalists\" were the target.</p>\n<p>To better understand what what it was like to be there on Saturday, watch <a\nhref=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU9Dx0x9h4A&amp;feature=related\">this extraordinary video\ndocument</a>, taken by someone positioned at the corner where I was standing.</p>\n<p>I did not see the incident in which a senior officer maced a group of young women already\nenclosed in the net, but I now know that it happened a few yards in front of where I was\nstanding, and I did hear people screaming. What I did spot briefly was the figure of a young\nman on University Place holding up an American flag to his chest (by the way, I don't remember\nanyone on the Left carrying or displaying American flags until this movement appeared; I think\nit says something pretty remarkable about people finally wanting to take back their country).\nSeconds later I saw one of the white shirts bolt from some 50 feet north of where he was\nstanding, almost fly across the divide which separated them, and attack the kid, throwing or\nflipping him onto the pavement. I wasn't able to see what happened next, I think because it\nwas at that moment that I was shoved away from the corner and I and my camera briefly took\nrefuge behind a large post box bolted to the pavement.</p>\n<p>During the time I was at Union Square, on University Place, 12th Street and later on Fifth\nAvenue, I never saw less than a hundred people, and often many more, witnessing what the\npolice were doing.

It was after being home for a\nwhile that I came to find out about the <b><a\nhref=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH3kiaJ1-c8\">arrests at the Citibank</a></b> downtown.\nThis pissed me off greatly and I felt a need to be in solidarity with those in Times Square.\nSo I packed my backpack with snacks and my camera, jotted down the number to the NY Lawyers\nGuild on my arm in a Sharpie (in case I was arrested) and off I went.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qO1k-UDgSJ4/Tpo_G6W610I/AAAAAAAAAvA/TXVczTYe1wQ/s1600/OccupyTimesSq_426.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"320\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qO1k-UDgSJ4/Tpo_G6W610I/AAAAAAAAAvA/TXVczTYe1wQ/s320/OccupyTimesSq_426.jpg\"\nwidth=\"209\" /></a></div>\nAlthough I was several blocks away from Times Square, I could already tell this was going to\nbe bigger than anything I had previously been a part of. I took a whole lot of pictures,\ntalked to people, chanted, met Michael Moore and even chatted it up with the NYPD.<br />\n<br />\nThings were quite pleasant and upbeat until about 6:50pm. At that time, police on horses\nshowed up. About ten minutes later, hundreds of police officers swarmed onto 46th and\nBroadway. I left the area I was at and followed them, clicking away on my camera, only to\ndiscover that they were barricading the crowd in. Seconds later, riot police showed up in full\ngear. Everyone got out their cameras and phones and began recording the situation while\nchanting <i>\"the whole world is watching\"</i>. Myself and several hundred people were\nbarricaded on 46th Street, with nowhere to go. Fearing that the situation was about to get out\nof hand, I quickly logged onto my Facebook account and started updating my status, so that my\nfriends and my hubby would know what was going down. Soon after, the police on horses started\ndrawing closer and closer to the crowd and at one point a couple of officers on their horses\nran right up to the barricade, knocking it over and sparking a stampede. A woman fell and hit\nher head. Blood was on the ground. There was nowhere to go seeing as we were barricaded in.\nSomeone started the 'people's microphone' and helped calm the crowd down. Me, I was crouched\nnear a large pot, fearful that I would get trampled given the fact that I was the shortest one\nin sight. I continued to update my Facebook status, concerned that the police's actions would\nescalate the situation into a riot. A short time later, a man wearing a suit got on his\nmegaphone and asked the police to stand down.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sl_snPqSUec/Tpo_TdPSvWI/AAAAAAAAAvI/x7A0wizPFhA/s1600/OccupyTimesSq_483.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"140\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sl_snPqSUec/Tpo_TdPSvWI/AAAAAAAAAvI/x7A0wizPFhA/s320/OccupyTimesSq_483.jpg\"\nwidth=\"320\" /></a></div>\nWe were still barricaded in, with the metal barricades linked onto each other all the way\naround the area we were at. More police arrived, (and then even more and MORE police arrived)\nand they stood shoulder to shoulder around the barricade. Behind them, were the police on\nhorses. People asked how they could get out and there was no response from the officers. I\nwalked the perimeter of the barricade and didn't see a way out. I stopped for a while and took\nmore pictures. At one point, a woman behind me yelled over to the officers that she was a\ntourist, with a child and needed help getting to her hotel. The officer looked right through\nher, not seeing her nor responding. After an hour of being barricaded in, I decided to walk\nthe perimeter once more and that's when I found that one of the metal barricades was missing\nseveral rods and there was space enough for me to squeeze through. Since at this location\nthere were significantly less officers, I decided to go for it. I pushed my backpack through\nthe gap, squeezed myself on through and made a run for the subway station. I didn't look back\nfor fear of seeing police officers chasing my ass, about to take me down.<br />\n<br />\nMore pictures can be found <b><a\nhref=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2270841405347.120431.1077964475&amp;type=1&amp;l=d949fbb110\">\nhere</a></b>.</div>"], ["Blind Carbon Copy: Peaceful protesters, violent cops", "http://bccwords.blogspot.com/2011/10/peaceful-protesters-violent-cops.html", "Blind Carbon Copy", "http://bccwords.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-1480296815703751562'>So yesterday (Friday\nOctober 21) the inspiring Occupy Melbourne protest in City Square was violently evicted in\nwhat would best be described as a police riot.<br />\n<br />\nI arrived at the protest after the main eviction had occurred. Nicola has <a\nhref=\"http://www.indymedia.org.au/2011/10/22/the-eviction-of-one-space-the-start-of-another#comment-16115\">\na description</a> of some of that earlier action up on Indymedia. That was the most violent\npart of the day.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I returned late in the morning, many who had been dragged through the dirt and dumped on\nthe kerb on their face were wandering around, a bit shocked. Supporters had gathered and\nwitnessed the eviction, occupying the intersection of Collins and Swanston St.<br />\n<br />\nSoon the police pushed us out of the intersection in a big line, shoving the protesters, who\nslowly gave ground and mainly converged in front of the town hall on Swanston St. Dave, a\nrespected union veteran , was holding the protesters organised into a peaceful line, with the\nintent of moving slowly up Swanston St in front of the police, as they pushed us. \"Do not\ncontest - when the push, we move slowly\" was the chant.<br />\n<br />\nDave was quickly dragged away in a headlock by about four police, and we didn't see him until\nhe was released that evening. Happy 60th birthday, Dave! Right after this - thinking,\nprobably, that they had removed our \"leader\" - the riot squad formed into a V and pushed right\ninto the protest, apparently trying to drive us onto the footpath and up the street.<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\"\nstyle=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iWFnnzCBDDQ/TqJfgKej5lI/AAAAAAAAAu4/EcZQxoqj--g/s1600/riot+squad+V+formation.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"239\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iWFnnzCBDDQ/TqJfgKej5lI/AAAAAAAAAu4/EcZQxoqj--g/s320/riot+squad+V+formation.jpg\"\nwidth=\"320\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">This great pic was borrowed from\nfacebook</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<a id=\"more\" name='more'></a><br />\n<br />\nThis was the most police violence that I personally witnessed. We were pushed up against rows\nof police cars on the side of the street so we couldn't move, while the psychos of the riot\nsquad kept pushing and shoving aggressively, and occasionally grabbing people. People fell\nover; one guy fell in front of me under the police line and immediately had a riot squad goon\n(without ID badge) jump on him, punch him in the face, and drag him away.<br />\n<br />\nI suspect this was the point where Greens upper house MP Colleen Hartland, standing aside and\nwatching, was randomly shoved into a wall by one of the uniformed goons. Many in the police\nheirarchy will be very uncomfortable with these excesses that are so well documented on so\nmany cameras.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://mike-stuchbery.com/2011/10/21/smacked-up/\">Another blogger</a> seems to have\nseen (and felt) much worse than me at this point. When I say the police were violent, it is\nnot a rhetorical flourish.<br />\n<br />\nThey pushed us up the street to the next intersection (Bourke St), where the protest stopped\nand some attempt at discussing what to do next was made. Eventually various people decided\nTrades Hall would be a safe space to retire to; we were pushed up the road again by the\npolice, retreating slowly all the way, arms linked in a line. There was less aggro at this\nstage, just grumpy cops and some fairly outraged protesters.<br />\n<br />\nWhat flabbergasted me was that, even after all the protesters had decided to move to Trades\nHall, the police line followed us, pushing, still grabbing random people out of the crowd in\nheadlocks and dragging them away for arrest. The police were truly out of control.<br />\n<br />\nEven as the crowd arrived at Trades Hall, the police lined up outside and herded the crowd\nonto the lawn at the front of the hall, as though they could chase us right into the union\nhall. The police association ought to be ashamed: just a week or two earlier, they had a huge\nbanner on the hall, supporting their claim for a pay rise. Today I think many would agree\ntheir membership in Trades Hall ought to be brought into question.<br />\n<br />\nHowever little the rank and file police have to do with the decisions to evict protesters,\nthere is no excuse for the kind of violence I saw. Arresting people need not be accompanied by\na punch to the face, a knee on the chest, or a chokehold on neck pressure points that was\nshown graphically in Herald Sun photos today.<br />\n<br />\nThe remaining protesters camped in the trades hall and held an assembly, where they decided to\nmeet again and peacefully rally in the city today.<br />\n<br />\nI just came back from this: despite pouring rain, around a thousand marched through the city\ncentre, held another assembly in front of Trades Hall, and decided to march back past the City\nSquare again, to identify it as the point for a re-occupation next Saturday when the plan is\nto return with enough numbers that we cannot be stopped.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI'm happy that I arrived early in the morning on Friday and collected up two tents. The police\nand council demolished the camp without regard for people's property: it was compacted and\ntaken to the tip. I may be needing those tents again!<br />\n<br />\nToday also saw a clear demand from this \"demandless\" movement: for Lord Mayor Robert Doyle to\nresign. Amen to that.<br />\n</div>"], ["The Grim Reefer: Occupy Oakland and the General Strike", "http://thegrimreefer.blogspot.com/2011/11/occupy-oakland-and-general-strike.html", "The Grim Reefer", "http://thegrimreefer.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-1523526129931947705'><a\nonblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-POLDRy3kzPM/TrXfUcnPV6I/AAAAAAAAAIc/6NDED69wk4w/s1600/IMG_0326.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-POLDRy3kzPM/TrXfUcnPV6I/AAAAAAAAAIc/6NDED69wk4w/s320/IMG_0326.JPG\"\nalt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5671684848114161570\" border=\"0\" /></a>Dear Readers,<br />\nToday we are bringing you some shots from Occupy Oakland's General Strike.<br />\nAbove you can see the seen at the entrance to the Port Of Oakland.

A group of us gathered there and had a street dialogue\nabout this. Most everyone agreed that this was not a good move, that this was not something we\napproved of, and that it was not how we wanted to be. It was pointed out that this kind of\nthing would allow the police to justify their later violent tactics. However, as you can also\nsee, one of our group made a sign saying \"we are Better than this.\" When one of the so called\n\"black masked\" folks confronted us, a 17 year old (black) kid responded by saying when we\ndestroy property, we have already lost... that this kind of thing will destroy the movement,\nand turn public opinion against the movement. He was joined by a middle aged white woman, an\nIndian fellow and a variety of other people. It seemed to me to be a true multicultural moment\nto me. The fellow who was arguing with us kept insisting that property damage wasn't\nviolence.<br />\nFor the record, I do not agree, and I as a citizen and a participant in this march condemn\nthese violent acts, the destruction of property and indeed the rhetoric of \"kill cops\" and so\nforth. There are obviously some serious problems with the way police treat people, but when we\nbehave like this and threaten police, we are not rising above the haze.<br />\nWe ARE better than this, and we are going to have to prove it.<br />\n<br />\n<a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"\nhref=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wvOm4lfc1IE/TrXeixxPH0I/AAAAAAAAAHM/fb3jqanT5VA/s1600/IMG_0333.JPG\">\n<img\nstyle=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;\"\nsrc=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wvOm4lfc1IE/TrXeixxPH0I/AAAAAAAAAHM/fb3jqanT5VA/s320/IMG_0333.JPG\"\nalt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5671683994799775554\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />\nThis is the most upsetting shot to me.... After the nice day with the limited casualties of\nthe bank windows, these same \"Black Masked\" people started making barricades at both ends of\nthe street just above Oscar Grant Plaza. There was terrible energy there, and I'd say about\n200 + people running around gearing up to fight the police. I considered trying to tear the\nbarricades down, but I did not have any support and these folks did not seem like they cared\nabout anything but creating problems. I maybe should have tried anyway.<br />\nEither way, I think Occupy should have been a little more organized to try to stop this from\nhappening... I'm not entirely sure what that would look like, but if we'd had enough people\nout there (granted it was 11 at night and most people had gone home after the long day) we\nmight have been able to stop this. Or maybe we would have had to fight these same people,\nwhich goes against the very point of this movement.<br />\n<br />\nThe police began to come down Telegraph Ave and Broadway, and the \"Black Masked\" folk began to\nfind rocks and things. I felt this was a good time to be else where since no one was listening\nto me, and I didn't want to be trapped in an alley way with 200 maniacs set on fighting riot\npolice and then teargassed, maybe beaten and arrested.<br />\nSo i went across to Broadway and 17th, where the police were beginning to push folks around.\nThey knocked a few people down... and then fired two tear gas canisters down the block. there\nwere also at least two flash bangs in the clouds... echoing off the buildings. People\nunderstandably dispersed, myself moving a bit down 16th street where I continued to yell...\n\"Don't do this... you have a CHOICE.... you have a Choice.\" I admit the rest is a bit blurry\nas the gas reached me and i began to tear and it bit into my throat and also my nose, and it\nfelt like my skin was burning, and I became fairly dizzy. I managed to snap off the shot above\nsomewhere during this exchange. My colleague confronted the police again... and she was\ntelling them she loved them, and not to use violence... and that is when they fired flash\nbangs at her feet. This was followed in short succession with a tear gas canister which landed\njust behind her feet.<br />\n<br />\nAfter that i became fairly upset, and I had trouble standing up straight. We again confronted\nthe police imploring them to stop what they were doing... and I think I told them we needed\ntheir help, as well as repeating \"don't DO this\".<br />\nIt was some time later that we decided to retreat. The \"Black Masked\" folks one block over had\nduring this lit their barricades on fire and as I understand it, <span\nstyle=\"font-style: italic;\">were</span> throwing things at the police. I felt this was an\nespecially bad choice and began cursing loudly because this was a terrible way to end what had\nbeen a beautiful day. I felt like i was watching someone I loved get buried. And I'm pissed\noff about the \"black masked\" whatever the fuck they want to be called. And <span\nstyle=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;\" class=\"J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc\">I'm</span> mad at\nthe Police for firing teargas at people on our block who were nonviolent and who weren't\nthrowing shit. And the whole thing was a disgrace... at the end of the most impressive\ncommunity action I've ever been a part of.<br />\n<br />\nI guess I will leave this today with two thoughts.<br />\nThink about things...don't just quote what the media says, don't just accept the police\nreports. The Black masked Cretins were way out of line, but that still does not justify that\nmuch tear gas and flash bangs. (I forgot to mention that i heard a great deal more of that\ncoming from what I think was telegraph and 15th on the other side of the building there. there\nwas a lot of weaponry fired, and it sounded like bombing)<br />\n<br />\nThe second thing is just because it's night doesn't mean your actions can't be seen. <span\nstyle=\"background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;\" class=\"J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc\">Jah</span> can see\nyou under the cover of dark, and I want to offer that the the Black Mask dick fucks, and also\nthe Oakland Police department.<br />\nYour actions can be seen, and they were.<br />\n<br />\nWe're going to have to do better than this.<br />\n<br />\n(Also, the following night we went to city hall and addressed the city council. you can <span\nstyle=\"\" class=\"J-JK9eJ-PJVNOc\">watch</span> on their website.)<br />\nGWC</div>"], ["Movies That Motivate | The Adventures of Motivatorman!: Tip#369: Stay Cool, Calm and Confident - G20 Summit Toronto - The Matrix Reloaded", "http://motivatorman.blogspot.com/2010/06/tip369-stay-cool-calm-and-confident-g20.html", "Movies That Motivate | The Adventures of Motivatorman!", "http://motivatorman.blogspot.com/", "<div class='post-body entry-content'>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Fr85Hz6ouBU/TCtCKHpRXYI/AAAAAAAABOc/GJAxAldKQmU/s1600/matrix_reloaded_ver14.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Fr85Hz6ouBU/TCtCKHpRXYI/AAAAAAAABOc/GJAxAldKQmU/s320/matrix_reloaded_ver14.jpg\" /></a></div>\nBeing in the right place and the right time can feel fantastic (see <a\nhref=\"http://bit.ly/aDwGbV\">tip#368</a>).

I\nnever dreamed of loans and it seemed the only option was a state school. But I had dithered\nand delayed enough to miss the application deadline for UMass, Amherst. I was dejected to be\nat home and the start of my academic career was less than brilliant. My mother also had a\nmajor psychotic break just as my first semester started. This complicated life as our father\nwas the navigator on a supply ship in the North Sea. Since my mother had seasonal bipolar\ndisorder we were, in a weird way, accustomed to the every other year, chaos and culminating\nhospitalizations. But that is another story. I would have been miserable anyway. At a\nuniversity, my BU admission counselor had told me, you can avail yourself of so many\ninteresting electives. BU was plenty artsy. I wanted to be a film maker and BU's SPC was\nconsidered by many the best film school, after NYU, on the east coast. A family friend, who\nworked in the film industry convinced me that I should not study film but some other,\nunrelated discipline because, said he, \" Anyone can learn the technical part, but you need to\nhave ideas and something to say to make a good film.\" Besides, I did not have a have a\nportfolio that would get me into any film or art school. BU seemed a good compromise - I could\nstudy liberal arts and take courses in film and visual art. They don't tell you how little one\ncould do at BU as a College of Liberal Arts freshman. No transferring between schools at the\nuniversity, no taking classes with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Sexton\">Anne\nSexton</a> and other celeb teachers. What a crock! I thought. My friends at U Mass Amherst\nwere taking classes with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe\">Chinua\nAchebe</a> as freshmen while I sat in huge lecture classes with 600 other freshman, waiting\nuntil we were seniors to see if we might be one of the lucky 12 to study with whoever might be\nthe visiting author. I was so alienated and lonely. Academically, I was a wreck. A very poor\nmath student, I was also dismayed to be a philosophy major where the study of philosophy was\nlargely focused on <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Silber\"\nrel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"John Silber\">John Silber</a>'s homeboy, Immanuel Kant and symbolic\nlogic. Boring, irrelevant and impossible stuff - not a course of study for me.<br />\n<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGwtCdRUykI/AAAAAAAABZ8/uh5VmmDXnok/s1600/Dog_attack_small.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"200\"\nsrc=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGwtCdRUykI/AAAAAAAABZ8/uh5VmmDXnok/s200/Dog_attack_small.jpg\"\nwidth=\"121\" /></a>When Silber tried to bring ROTC came back on campus during the second\nsemester the students and faculty rose up in opposition. We felt the war was now at \"home\" and\nwe wanted to keep BU from any complicity with the <a class=\"zem_slink\"\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex\" rel=\"wikipedia\"\ntitle=\"Military-industrial complex\">military-industrial complex</a>. We petitioned, we\nmarched, we had teach-ins, we took over buildings and many students were arrested. Once, at an\nearly demo, I was stranded behind a line of riot police and their dogs. There was no \"riot\".\nBut there were a few hundred students rallying in front of the President's Office on Bay State\nRoad. The order had been give to disperse and we often tested the strength of our \"right to\npeaceful assembly\" and our convictions by refusing to move. I looked to my left and realized\nthat John Silber, was at my elbow. He took no notice of me, but I still remember admiring the\ncolors of his sienna, rust brown and maroon tweed jacket. Silber, then the new BU president\ndidn't notice me. He had his attention on the approach of a TV news team. Froth and spit flew\nfrom his lips as he directed their attention, pointing out a young man who was being attacked\nby an off leash police dog. \"Look at him! Look at him!\", said John Silber, gesturing\nemphatically with his good arm. \" Why don't you film him? He is deliberately trying to incite\na riot by <i><b>teasing</b></i> that dog\". The terrified student was stumbling backwards,\nlifting his arms upwards as the dog tried to bite him. The police had let the dogs off their\nleashes, put down their visors and were attacking hapless students with long brown batons. Any\nnormal person could read the fear in the student's face. Suddenly, the lines of police and\ndemonstrators surged, merged and separated and I was on the right side of the police riot. And\nrunning away. This picture of John Silber as a wild man and sociopath is still seared in my\nmemory. Along with my shame at running away from the crack of the batons and the dogs, that\nmemory has fueled my determination to fight John Silber's abusive, deranged authority with\neverything I had. But, worried about my mother's precarious mental state, I embraced the\nstruggle with gusto <i><b>and</b></i> resolved not to get arrested because I might be needed\nat home. It was a pretty amazing conflict. I flunked quite a few of my courses but I got quite\nan education on justice, the legal system, and the nature of commitment to a struggle. I saw\nfrom front row court room seats that Lenny Bruce was right \"In the halls of justice, the only\njustice is in the halls\". These experiences made me wrestle with some essential and, as yet,\nunanswered, questions<br />\n<br />\n<a\nhref=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGwkYjTbG_I/AAAAAAAABZw/QHfcA7x-ZcQ/s1600/Student+Strike.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"130\"\nsrc=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGwkYjTbG_I/AAAAAAAABZw/QHfcA7x-ZcQ/s200/Student+Strike.jpg\"\nwidth=\"200\" /></a><br />\nWhat inspires people to fight against injustice, I wondered ? For us, <a class=\"zem_slink\"\nhref=\"http://howardzinn.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" title=\"Howard Zinn\">Howard Zinn</a>'s eloquent\nleadership was one reason. The recent murder of four students at an antiwar demonstration at\nKent State still resonated. The escalation of a war that should have been ending? Enlightened\nself interest is often posed as another impetus behind the anti -Vietnam war movement.\nAlthough, just like former veep <a class=\"zem_slink\"\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Dick Cheney\">Dick\nCheney</a>, Dr. Evil clone, <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://www.rove.com/\" rel=\"homepage\"\ntitle=\"Karl Rove\">Karl Rove</a> and former New York Mayor, <a class=\"zem_slink\"\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani\" rel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Rudy Giuliani\">Rudy\nGiuliani</a>, all the students had deferred draft status. What inspires movements for justice\nand peace and, more puzzling, what made people give up, when they hadn't won yet ? Justice was\nnot served and the <a class=\"zem_slink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War\"\nrel=\"wikipedia\" title=\"Vietnam War\">Vietnam War</a> dragged on. Our student movement fizzled\nand ROTC came to campus even after a long student and faculty strike. Political action was my\nmajor course of study but my dedication to it meant summer school to make up for all the\ncredits I lost marching up and down Comm Ave. That summer, my mother was well again and she\nnoticed how miserable I was. She helped me make a plan to work part-time and create a\nportfolio so I could apply to art schools. In the fall I was delighted to drop out of BU. I\nnever looked back.<br />\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\"\nstyle=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a\nhref=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGw0bXkes8I/AAAAAAAABaA/ZEoxHA7KGms/s1600/highschooldazecropped.jpg\"\nimageanchor=\"1\"\nstyle=\"clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img\nborder=\"0\" height=\"320\"\nsrc=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XwSWIl-bvZA/TGw0bXkes8I/AAAAAAAABaA/ZEoxHA7KGms/s320/highschooldazecropped.jpg\"\nwidth=\"300\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Post demo, circa 1974, the author holds a\nbanner with some friends</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<a class=\"zem_slink\"\nhref=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=42.351807,-71.065994&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=42.351807,-71.065994%20%28Emerson%20College%29&amp;t=h\"\nrel=\"geolocation\" title=\"Emerson College\">Emerson</a> College did not even have a film major\nback when I applied and was put on the waiting list.

This despite Egypt\nhaving had more bombings and shootings targeting tourists in recent years, more horrific bus\ncrashes every year and more media-hyped shark attacks on divers and swimmers this year than\nthe rest put together. And, sure enough, just a couple of days before we entered Egypt,\ninspired by the success of Tunisia's recent popular uprising, the Egyptians started causing\nthe long-running Mubarak government a few headaches. Depending on whose reports you believe,\nup to 300 people died while several million rioted across the country on one day alone.

There aren't as\nmany bars, but then there aren't as many obnoxious drunks, either, and there are plenty of\ncheap rooms and a wide range of food options and prices. You could take a camel or\nfour-wheeler to the desert, go snorkelling or diving, or sit around doing nothing all day.

Most appreciate the work\ndone by Mubarak in his early years, but feel a change is long overdue. \"Egypt is a rich\ncountry\", they tell us, \"but we have nothing.\" President Mubarak is listed as one of the\nrichest people in the world, and many of the officials around him also have personal fortunes\nwell above that of any honest politician. One story we hear is that of a politician trying to\nleave the country with two shipping containers; one full of US Dollar in cash, another full of\nEuro in cash.</span></div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><br />\n</div>\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;\">Discussing events\nat dinner one evening, the restaurateur told us that since rioting began, the police haven't\nbeen in once to collect their kick-backs. Most people blame the police for starting the\nviolence across the country; if the Mubarak government goes, they will no longer have its\nprotection and people will turn on them after all their years of corruption. Already during\nthe rioting across the country, many police stations have been targeted.

Dahab became a refuge for many tourists, even if only for a night or\ntwo; those who had been in Cairo during the riots had said they never felt threatened or\nendangered in any way, indeed, many were assisted by locals in getting away from rioters\nwithout any problems, but it was obviously more sensible to be elsewhere.

The sentiment against the war in Viet Nam\nwas growing exponentially, and the CHP had already been heavily involved with restoring order\nat the Isla Vista Riots near Santa Barbara. Most of the disorder and demonstrations were\ndirectly related to the anti war feeling in the country. My involvement in the Isla Vista\nriots are chronicled in the Feb 9 Blog Post.<br />\n<br />\nIn late Aug 1970, just a few months after the turmoil at the University of California at Santa\nBarbara, I found myself in the middle of more riots, much closer to where I lived and\nworked.<br />\n<br />\n<div>A parade, demonstration, and rally on Whittier Blvd. in the East Los Angeles area turned\ninto several days of rioting.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>It all started with a peaceful march of several thousand, mostly Latinos, up Whittier\nBlvd. to Laguna Park, where the rally was to climax. A liquor store near the park was\noverwhelmed, and people started walking out without paying. When Sheriff's Deputies began\narresting the casual looters, rocks and bottles were thrown, and the riot was on.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>A 20 block area along the Blvd. became a war zone, as looters and rioters battled the\nPolice. Tear gas grenades were the primary weapon against the rioters, and unfortunately, a\ntear gas projectile that was fired into the Silver Dollar Bar, struck and killed a well known,\nmilitant Mexican-American Journalist. When the death of reporter Ruben Salazar became known,\nthe riots intensified to the point where Los Angeles County called for help from the\nCHP.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>I was working the swing shift, when the surrounding CHP Offices began sending\nreinforcements into the East L.A. area. The Baldwin Park Office where I was assigned, was only\na few miles to the northeast of the riots, so our response was relatively quick. I paired up\nwith another Officer, and we were assigned an intersection adjacent to Whittier Blvd. The\nCHP's role was to secure the perimeter, so that the Sheriff's Deputies could handle the other\nproblems. When we arrived , the fire department was just starting to get into the area, and\nget control of the many fires that had been intentionally set. The area looked like a war\nzone, and there were occasional gun shots, that except for a general area, we had no idea who,\nor what they were directed toward. Our contact with the rioters was relatively small, but I\nremember the anger was intense, and anybody wearing a uniform became the focus of that anger.\nWe had several confrontations with individuals who wanted to pass our checkpoint, but nothing\nturned violent, just lots of angry words.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>With the arrival of the early morning hours, the violence had subsided considerably, and\nour job of keeping people out of the area had become fairly routine. Many of us were sent back\non successive days, but with the deployment of approx. 1,200 Deputies, the riots were pretty\nmuch contained to that first night.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div>The direct involvement with 2 large riots, within a few months of each other in 1970, had\nme wondering if my chosen career in traffic law enforcement was being partially hijacked. The\nneed to assist in peace keeping, at mostly anti Viet Nam war gatherings, was beginning to look\nlike a necessary part of the job.</div>\n<br />\n<br />\n</div>"], ["The gift and curse of the G20 in my city | rabble.ca", "http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/summit-stories/2010/08/gift-and-curse-g20-my-city?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rabble-news+%28rabble.ca+-+News+for+the+rest+of+us%29", "BlogsCanada.ca.com.net.org", "http://blogscanada.ca/blog", "<div class=\"body\">\n<p><em>\"Fascism begins the moment a ruling class, fearing the people may use their political\ndemocracy to gain economic democracy, begins to destroy political democracy in order to retain\nits power of exploitation and special privilege.\"</em></p>\n</div>\n\n- Tommy Douglas, 1942<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>Lack of corporate accountability is a bedrock issue for the anti-globalization movement, as\nI am beginning to understand in a whole new way.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing new about political and business elites making (or not making) deals\nbehind fortified doors.

Uncountable dollars were lost in missed opportunities for\nbusinesses that were shut down, tourists driven away, lives disrupted. But the serious story,\nthe frightening story, is the sharp erosion of hard-won civil rights, overnight, with\npolitical, media and civil complicity.</p>\n\n<p>Because the buildup in security before the G20 was \"newsworthy\" for weeks beforehand, I had\nquite a good chance to chew over how to respond to the invasion. I opened up a space for some\nvision of creative, loving and peaceful protest to emerge.

Canada's prime minister has\nunabashedly opposed this proposed declaration. His home province, rich in both oil and water\nsources, can make a killing from commodification of water. Making access a human right might\nnegatively impact his cronies' profit margin. This is consistent with his hard-on for the\ncrime scene that is the Alberta Tar Sands.</p>\n\n<p>I can't even get to the point of my loving protest image without my blood boiling with\noutrage.</p>\n\n<p>After the rally, the theatre emptied onto the street, and we marched in solidarity to a\ntent city of people protesting poverty and the treatment of the homeless (forced off the\nstreets for the G20). This group had earlier been harshly curtailed and harassed by the\npolice, who had, we believed, been granted extraordinary powers of arrest throughout the city.\n(We learned today that the</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://planetwaves.net/astrologynews/236713796.html\" target=\"_blank\">Police Chief\nlied</a> about aspects of this law, muddying the already filthy waters.) [Globe &amp; Mail]\n\n<p>Our experience of this walk was exuberant. Normal city police corralled us, no riot dudes\nwith truncheons and bad attitudes. But we knew they were nearby, thousands of them. Then we\nrode home through an eerily empty city (Friday night!). Noone on the streets. Feeling very\nunsafe.</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, June 26, 2010, being fully conscious of the astrology of the moment, I\nhonoured my son's sudden anxiety about going to the Civil Society March. I had no anxiety, but\nhe had an intuition it would be bad for him to be there, and I think he was right. So in\nflowing layers of blue, seashells, ocean-faced, I went to the protest alone.</p>\n\n<p>There were thousands upon thousands of beautiful people there. It was pouring with rain but\nno one seemed to care. I was blessed with good wishes and curiosity and openness all around. I\nwalked in my big boots for three hours at the front of the march, in the middle of the march,\nhanging out with anyone whose message and presence resonated with mine. It is an amazing thing\nto</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mL46t8H4oU&amp;sns=em\" target=\"_blank\">walk with so\nmany</a> in solidarity.<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>There was tension throughout. At every single intersection, police made a show of slowing\nus down. We were walking south, toward the fortified barricade, and they were not going to let\nus pass unobstructed. They did keep letting us pass, but each encounter raised blood pressure\non both sides. As Canadians, it is our right to assemble and to protest, and it is our right\nas protestors to be visible to the elite targets of our demonstration.</p>\n\n<p>When we got to Queen St., the riot police had formed an impenetrable line, three deep,\nbehind another line of police on bikes, so the march veered west. At one point, I saw a group\nof excited kids dressed in black t-shirts layered over colorful clothes, wearing black\nbandanas. Their energy was giddy and postured, like high-school kids considering trouble. I\nasked someone if they knew who they were, and heard \"anarchists.\" Similarly dressed\nindividuals were later filmed and photographed vandalizing corporate property, using notorious\nBlack Bloc tactics. I gave them a wide berth and carried on.</p>\n\n<p>My march concluded peacefully at the Provincial Legislature, or Queen's Park. This was the\ndesignated \"safe zone\" promised by security, and is a frequent location for protest. I stood\naround for a bit, talked to a few people, and decided to head home, elated that there had been\nno bad behaviour despite the tensions and hype.</p>\n\n<p>It was only then that I realized that in addition to the corridor that had been cordoned\noff for our march, the police had shut down all traffic, streetcars, and subway for at least\nsix blocks in all directions. I stopped someone to ask why the police were clearing the\nstreets, and she told me that there had been violence, and probably the police were\nafraid.</p>\n\n<p>A photojournalist has posted this footage which beautifully lays out what happened behind\nme, at the other end of the march.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsnGpIRQzkU&amp;feature=player_embedded\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Vandals ran wild</a> for hours and through miles of the city, without police\nintervention.\n\n<p>This version of the information as it unfolds in that video took days to surface beyond\nsocial media, because, I believe, the police and media conspired to use the spectacle of\nvandalism, particularly burning police cars, to justify the ridiculous security spend, and\nworse, to justify the brutal, violent arrest and illegal detainment of hundreds of innocent\npeople, preemptively before the protest and in the following days. Toronto takes the cake for\nboth most money spent and most arrests, somewhere in the area of 900.</p>\n\n<a\nhref=\"http://rabble.ca/news/2010/06/conditions-detainees-629-eastern-avenue-are-illegal-immoral-and-dangerous\"\n target=\"_blank\">Detainees were housed in appalling conditions</a>: overcrowded, denied\nadequate food, water and legal counsel. (I do not believe the 900 count includes the many more\nhundreds of \"catch and release\" arrests throughout the day on Sunday.)\n\n<p>The contrast between what I and thousands of others experienced and what was shown for the\nnext 24 hours on television was astounding. I spent hours trying to understand what was really\nhappening. Mainstream media ignored the 10 to 25K-strong march. All protesters were conflated\nimmediately with the anarchist vandals. No-one was covering any of the issues brought up by\nthe protests or those being addressed at the Summit. Media showed the same loop, over and\nover, of police cars on fire, vandals breaking windows, while twitter screamed and flashed\nimages of peaceful protesters being charged by riot police on horseback, beaten bloody,\ntear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets. My friend who works at CBC assured me the only thugs\nwere the Black Bloc Anarchists, and the police were doing a great job, no unnecessary\nviolence. The tear gas and rubber bullets weren't being picked up by mainstream media, and the\nPolice Chief denied it, so it simply wasn't so.</p>\n\n<p>Ah, to have such confidence in the powers that be.</p>\n\nLater, the truth. The turning point, in my observation, was when\n\n<a href=\"http://openfile.ca/blog/steve-paikin-tweets-g20-frontlines\" target=\"_blank\">Steve\nPaikin</a>, a well-established Toronto journalist tweeted that he was being manhandled and\nthreatened with arrest if he did not vacate an area where a group of 200 mostly middle-class\nprotestors were being squeezed in upon on all sides. There was no violence, and police gave no\nreason nor explanation for their actions. Paiken opted not to go to jail and was escorted\naway, while a journalist who writes for\n\n<em>The Guardian</em> was beaten in front of him and incarcerated. His tweets about this fact\nturned the discourse in the mainstream media. Recognizing the abuse of their own, and a\nfundamental democratic right denied, they began to squeak.\n\nThis tactic played out through two full days: journalists, camera people, all legitimate\naccredited press were expelled from areas where citizens were trapped, kettled for hours, tear\ngassed, beaten and arrested.\n\n<p>I cannot stress enough how utterly appalling and uncharacteristic these policing tactics\nare, here. This is not how protest is dealt with in my city. Who trained the riot police? Who\ncame up with the money for all this \"security\" yet protected no property? Who was calling the\nshots while the good ol' boys in black beat the snot out of unarmed civilians? And ordered our\npolice force to let the vandals run wild, and refuse aid to the injured? Who manufactured all\nthis HATE?</p>\n\n<p>Gentle friends came to the aid of a man who had suffered a blow to the head and were\ndirectly told that the police were \"not allowed\" to help them get an ambulance or take him to\nhospital. The OPP's motto is \"To serve and protect.\"</p>\n\n<p>Conspiracy theories abound. The police have been caught before, instigating violence in\nprotests by \"infiltrating\" or just plain impersonating the Black Bloc. There is evidence to\nindicate that undercover police were infiltrating for certain. Did they instigate and act as\nagent provocateurs? Did they let the vandals run unchecked for the brilliant PR? Was it part\nof a long-term plan, to justify the security spend and deepen the steady vilification of\ndissent, making conscious, critical citizenship criminal?</p>\n\n<p>I feel, in a perverse way, both the police and the anarchists were mutually successful.</p>\n\npolice set the stage for violence with an empty city, dehumanized riot police, profoundly\ninconvenienced public, visibly eroded civil rights. This is provocation on the one hand, and\ninvitation on the other. Violence as PR to justify violence and, in this case, an obscene\ngorging on new weapons and surveillance technology.\n\n<p>The most articulate justification for the anarchist violence I have read is that by\nselectively vandalizing corporate property, they reveal the extreme militarist architecture of\nthe society, and hope to radicalize the population.</p>\n\n<p>Two sides of one violent coin.

We arrived at Queen's Park around 12:40pm, and were greeted by the\nwatchful eye of police in the subway station as we changed into our rain gear. We headed\noutside to find an overwhelming amount of people in the pouring rain, dancing to the drums,\nlaughing, talking, and greeting each other. The number was later estimated to be a group of\n10,000 protesters. Early on, we observed two things: one, the excitement of the crowd, and\ntwo, the diversity and range of ages of people in the crowd. After a short set of speeches, it\nwas announced that women would lead the protest in recognition of the theme of Maternal and\nChild Health at this year's Summit, and the march began, taking half an hour for all\nprotesters to line up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Our approach was to remain in an observational capacity and to study the protest. We stuck\nto the sidewalks as much as possible, allowing us the space to move up and down the protest\nline. We joined throngs of journalists covering the protest, and spent our time photographing\nthe many different groups present at the protest and listening to chants and slogans such as\n\"The people, united, will never be defeated\", \"Whose Streets? Our streets!\" or \"Shame! Shame!\nShame!\"</p>\n\n<p>We observed that the mood of the protest changed for the negative at the first sight of\nriot police. Despite the yelling, my observation of the police was that they were watchful and\nconcentrating, but not unprofessional or angry. The police's method was to have two lines of\npolice - a soft line of regular cops in yellow rain jackets, and then one city block behind\nthem, a line, two police deep, of riot police standing at the ready.</p>\n\n<p>The diversity of groups present was visible - for example, labour unions, international\nNGOs like Amnesty International and Oxfam, groups protesting Human Rights abuses in China and\nindividuals who showed up, unhappy with the security spending for the Summits and looking for\nan outlet of that emotion. The diversity of messages was united by the fact that everyone was\nagainst the G8/G20 Summits.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, Black Bloc protesters appeared clad in their uniforms of black and with\nmasked faces in the name of anonymity. We took shelter on the steps of Old City Hall and saw a\ngroup of an estimated 500 Black Bloc protesters and another 500 regular protesters come\nrunning down Queen, turning right on Bay. Apprehensive, we watched as the Black Bloc seemed to\nstand still, with an apparent absence of police presence, until we saw fire - the first police\ncar had been set on fire. Unsure of the volatility of the situation, and aware that the TTC\nwas closed, we headed north on foot and eventually made our way back to the IMC.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Globe and Mail, National Post and other news sources with live feeds of\nthe action, the protest started at Queen's Park, went down University Avenue and turned west\non Queen Street. As the end of the protest turned to march back up Spadina, a group of Black\nBloc protesters assembled and took off running in the opposite direction of the protest.

I've never been anything close to patriotically Canadian, as\na Mohawk citizen, but this year was a particular sore point.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Days earlier, myself and around 899 others were rounded up and detained in the biggest mass\narrest in Canadian history. Many were picked up for simply participating in one of many\npeaceful demonstrations. Journalists were rounded up. Legal observers too. Many people simply\nout for a walk ended up getting caught \"kettled\" by the police, arbitrary arrest measures\nwhich ensure that everyone in a certain zone is detained, guilty or not.</p>\n\n<p>On June 24, I had taken part in a national Indigenous Day of Action, called by the</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.defendersoftheland.org\" target=\"_blank\">Defenders of the Land</a> network,\nwhich brought out around 2,000 people to a rally in Toronto. Indigenous leaders and activists\nfrom Toronto and communities across the country -- Barriere Lake and tar sands-impacted\ncommunities were particularly prominent -- took the opportunity presented by the G20 to speak\nout against Canada's ongoing colonial legacy and called for implementation of the UN\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and investigation into the near 600 missing\nand murdered Indigenous women.\n\n<p>The rally was a success and also featured an evening gathering. Many who participated in\nthat day's events were also out on Saturday, June 26, amongst thousands for the G20 protest,\nbut that day didn't smile as favourably them.</p>\n\n<p>As for me, I was one of thousands forced out of Queen's Park, supposedly meant to be a\n\"free speech zone\" during the day. For the first time, I saw police demonstrate the\nsnatch-and-grab technique, where they would randomly select (peaceful) protestors, run them\ndown, tackle them, and often beat them -- while yelling out things like \"Stop resisting\narrest!\" or \"Prisoner is biting!\" A TTC worker on his way to work</p>\n\n<p>After leaving Queen's Park, protestors were virulent. They overtook Bloor, then Yonge,\nyelling \"The pigs pushed us out!\" and \"The cops made us march!\" Soon, we were face to face\nwith the security wall, as officers scrambled away and let us be to chant and sing across from\nthe wall. (I'll never perhaps understand many protestors decision to sing Oh Canada at this\npoint -- maybe they still believed in that idea?) Soon after we found ourselves surrounded by\npolice in riot gear.</p>\n\n<p>It looked bleak -- we backed away from the fence but were trapped against a wall, some 300\nof us. Police advanced, clanging their shields in a brute show of intimidation. We weren't\ngoing to give them a reason to take us. People began cheering \"Peaceful protest!\" as they sat\ndown with their hands in the air. Finally, a group of us managed to talk to the police\nrepresentatives, who agreed to let us pass through police lines. We were more than happy to\ncarry on.</p>\n\n<p>A few blocks later, our path already delineated by lines of riot cops, and we advanced\nagain parallel to the fence. We were stopped by one line of police, a block away from the\nfence. The group decided to again sit down, choosing to ignore the torrential rains, and\npassed around the megaphone to declare our reasons for being in the streets to oppose the G20\nagenda. A suggestion was made to move down the streets a few blocks to the Novotel Hotel,\nwhere many of the G20's delegates were staying. A fateful decision.</p>\n\n<p>At the hotel we made a pretty big spectacle. Certainly nobody expected 200 of us, and we\ntook over the narrow street and sidewalk. The crowd was peaceful to that point. Within minutes\nwe were surrounded by police in full riot gear. They marched, beating their shields, demanding\nattention and obedience. We responded by sitting down on the ground, peace signs in the air,\nmaking it clear we had no violent intentions. One police leader came forward, asking to speak\nto a union representative -- obviously confusing us with a rally by striking hotel workers\nearlier that week. When nobody filled that role, communications broke down.</p>\n\n<p>The snatch-and-grabs began. Protestors were picked off seemingly at random, preference\ngiven to those who spoke on the megaphone. Media were told to leave the area or face arrest,\nwith the exception of Jesse Rosenfeld, a writer for the UK's The Guardian, who was assaulted\nand arrested because his Alternative Media Centre pass was not recognized. There was a\ncomplete sense of confusion, near panic. No explanation was offered, and it was only after\nabout 20 people had been dragged away that the police let us know we were being arrested for\n\"breach of the peace,\" and could avoid being aggressively detained by lining up in front of\nthem with our hands on our heads. At no point was any indication made of ways to disperse or\ndesist from breaching whatever peace existed.</p>\n\n<p>As our last act of defiance, the crowd sang a number of songs, most memorably Bob Marley's\n\"Redemption Song,\" and \"I Shot the Sheriff.\" A few of us managed to get out word about what\nwas happening, and the electronic media world erupted into a frenzy, as word reached us that\nreporters were being kept away. Afterwards I found out that a few intrepid documentarians had\nfootage of our arrest, including police shooting \"pepper balls\" at us -- a mixture of tear gas\nand rubber bullets. Before being arrested, I managed to swap out my camera's memory card with\na blank one, and hide all my footage from that day in a hidden jacket pocket which wasn't\nsearched.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>It was about 11 p.m. when the mass arrests started, and past 1 a.m. when they finally\nstripped us of our property, down to our belts and shoelaces, and processed us. After our\nhands and ankles were bound, I was loaded into the back of a paddy wagon for a while.\nInexplicably, we were later transferred onto a waiting prison bus, a whole crew of us in the\nback. It was close to 2:30 a.m. before we left the area, and drove for half an hour to reach\nthe makeshift detention centre, a converted film studio. There we spent another hour waiting\non the bus, before entering the first of four cages which most of us had to pass through. The\ncages were about 8 by 12 feet, maybe 9 feet tall. I heard 40 people were crammed into one\ncell. Shortly after arriving, I recognized prisoners arriving who hadn't been with us by the\nhotel. They told us they had been outside the prison, where they showed up for jail solidarity\n-- peacefully chanting, singing, having food ready -- when police again kettled them, and\narrested a number of them.</p>\n\n<p>Spirits were still high in the first cell, but gradually diminished. Some had already been\nwaiting there over 12 hours, the police having lost their paperwork. This happened often.\nDuring this time the detainees had received one less-than-nutritious cheese sandwich and glass\nof water -- we also received one after arriving. After a few hours, I was processed further\nand moved to the second holding area, where I was stripped of my glasses, bracelets and\njacket. It was nearly 7 a.m., and I had yet to sleep, so against all odds I passed out on the\ncold concrete floor for a while, despite the screams and yelling emanating from other cells. I\nwoke up again to be moved to the third holding area, after meeting a police sergeant who read\nme my rights, including the right to legal counsel.</p>\n\n<p>As I moved into the third area, I was placed into an empty cell. I took advantage of the\npeace and got some more sleep. I woke up to the presence of another prisoner in my cell who\nhad also been at the Novotel protest. Two others soon followed. In the third cell, spirits\nwithered into despair, frustration and anger as the day wore on. Peaceful songs gave way to\ncries of \"Let us free!\" \"This is Bullshit!\" and my personal favourite, \"We want vegetables!\"\nwhich precipitated a long period of people shaking their cages and doors. The four of us paced\nback and forth. I was finally granted access to a payphone to call legal defence, who\nexplained my rights and the presumed process. Others were denied this right, police at times\nmaking fun of demands to speak to a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that basic violation, many of us suffered other injustices and indignities. We were\noften refused water, food and medical assistance. The building was kept very cold, making it\nimpossible for many to get any sleep on the concrete floor. More seriously, toilet paper and\ntampons were denied, and many women complained of male officers watching them use the\ndoor-less portapotties. There were even reports of sexual harassment and threats against\nfemale prisoners. Again, it must be stressed, that nearly everyone in the facilities was being\nheld without charge -- not that this kind of treatment is merited under other\ncircumstances.</p>\n\n<p>After over 20 hours being detained, I was moved to the final holding area -- called the\n\"catch-and-release\" zone, an admission that we were being brought in to keep us off the\nstreets. Paperwork finally filed, we were read conditions of release that said we would be\ncharged if detained again during the G20 -- which lawyers have since asserted is an invented\nscare tactic, since conditions can't be applied without charges. I was handed a bag of my\nthings and pushed out the door into the torrential rain without my shoes on. I realized my\nbackpack, wallet, and camera weren't returned to me, and would find out later they were being\nheld as evidence -- a fate that befell many other photographers and videographers.</p>\n\n<p>Then, just as quickly as we had been made illegal we were free again. Outside, dozens of\npeople were waiting, cheering with each release, and offering food and water. Other friends\nand colleagues were released that night, and we spent much of the night catching up. The next\nfew days were intense, filled with rallies, media interviews, and meetings. It has been tough\nto understand everything that happened, including that we had no idea that hundreds more were\nrounded up on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Much has been made of the official explanations for the police acting in such a punitive,\narbitrary and violent way. They explained they went after the crowds because they contained\n\"violent\" Black Bloc elements -- near impossible to determine, as those people had shed their\nclothing. We need to ask if this would ever be sufficient reason for suspending people's basic\nrights, when the most damage seems to have been some police cars burnt -- less than when\nhockey fans riot. Police carried out a dangerous form of collective punishment that tarnished\neveryone who publicly chose to disagree with Emperor Harper as violent criminals who needed\nlocking up. And with those burning cars, the police would have us believe, went up in smoke\nthe constitution, the bill of rights, international human rights law, and all common\nsense.</p>\n\n<p>The police and their puppeteers may have bitten off more than they can chew. If they had\nsimply picked up large numbers of activists, the response may have been more muted. Instead,\nthey detained and often violently assaulted many of Canada's top organizers, many members of\nthe media, legal observers, and people out in the streets who learned that being in the wrong\nplace at the wrong time can lead to your rights being suspended. Class-action suits are being\nconsidered and prepared. Demands for a public inquiry grow, with thousands having participated\nin rallies from Montreal to Windsor. Organizations and activists who rarely find themselves\nworking together, such as Amnesty International to No One Is Illegal to Indymedia journalists\nhave found a new fight.</p>\n\n<p>If there was anything positive to come from this experience, it would be just that. A group\nof individuals, organizations and social movements were united by the system of oppression\nthey encountered in trying to express their rights. We were attacked with The most promising\nweapons remain those in the hands of the people. Our word, our dignity, our passion, our\ntruth. If properly harnessed, we will be able to speak and act without fear of repression,\nviolence and detention -- and that's something every citizen and non-citizen alike could be\nproud of.</p>\n\nby clicking here.<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p><em>Ben Powless is a Mohawk from Six Nations in Ontario, and is currently studying Human\nRights Indigenous and Environmental Studies at Carleton University in Ottawa.

We knew\nthe army would come - the question was when. About 7:30 p.m., six armored personnel carriers\nwith mounted machine guns arrived at the main square. Then something extraordinary happened:\nThe soldiers were surrounded by hundreds of people - and after several minutes, welcomed. As I\nwrite this, ordinary citizens are walking up to the two vehicles stationed at Ramleh Square,\nand photographing each other flashing victory signs. The mood, tense for so much of the day,\nis turning festive.\n\n<p>When my interpreter and I arrived in Alexandria this morning, tension already hung in the\nair. Overnight, many activists, lawyers and members of the Muslim Brotherhood had been\ndetained. But the only visible sign of the anti-government protests that had roiled Egypt in\nrecent days was the heavy security presence: truck after truck of riot police roamed the\nstreets.</p>\n\n<p>We headed to a mosque in eastern Alexandria to observe the Friday midday prayer, the week's\nmain prayer. The imam gave a relatively neutral sermon, speaking about one's duty to God.\nDuring the service, three big trucks and an armored car full of riot police parked next to the\nmosque.</p>\n\n<p>When the prayer ended, as people streamed out of the mosque, many unfurled banners and\nbegan shouting slogans: \"The people want to end the regime.\" \"Raise your slogans, raise them\nhigh, he who shouts will never die.\" \"Gamal, tell your father that all the Egyptian people\nhate you.\" \"Down with Hosni Mubarak.\" Most, however, raised their hands in the air and yelled\nagain and again, \"We are peaceful.\" Expecting trouble, we headed to the roof of an adjoining\napartment building.</p>\n\n<p>Almost immediately, the armored police van started shooting tear gas directly at the crowd,\nengulfing them in acrid smoke. Our eyes burned as we watched. Police viciously attacked the\nprotesters, even though the overwhelming majority had clearly expressed the desire to rally\npeacefully.</p>\n\n<p>For the next two hours, the streets below us became a struggle between the police and the\nprotesters. Both sides threw rocks. The police never managed to advance a block, even as they\nfired shot after shot of rubber bullets and sprayed tear gas. Some of the protesters set tires\non fire. Even families in apartments around the area threw water bottles out their windows at\nthe police, outraged at the brutality with which they had attacked.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkable scenes unfolded in front of us. Repeatedly, groups of unarmed protesters raised\ntheir hands and approached riot police officers, only to be met with rubber bullets and tear\ngas.</p>\n\n<p>Then the tide suddenly turned: A massive crowd, easily thousands of protesters, came down a\nsecond road. The police now faced two fronts and a rain of rocks.</p>\n\n<p>And then the police ran out of bullets and tear gas. They began to beg over the sound\nsystem of an armored car, saying, \"Stop, young men, let it be finished\" and \"we'll end it\nnow.\" But the crowd didn't want to give up.</p>\n\n<p>The tear gas canisters the police had fired were turned back against them, and the wind\ncarried it around. Soon we were all retching, overwhelmed by thick clouds of tear gas.</p>\n\n<p>When we regained our senses, a remarkable scene lay before us. The protesters had won. The\npolice had given up, and protesters were now bringing the officers water and vinegar to deal\nwith the tear gas. People were embracing, protesters and police.</p>\n\n<p>Then the ordinary people who had watched the battle from their windows came down and joined\nthe crowd. Suddenly people were everywhere. Time seemed frozen, and people walked around in a\ndaze, not daring to believe that they had triumphed over the feared security forces.</p>\n\n<p>The police simply left. Crowds of people began walking, quickly filling the massive road\nalong the Mediterranean Sea. We joined them, eager to see what would happen next.</p>\n\n<p>Every few minutes, we were met by new crowds, exhausted but victorious in other battles\nwith the police. So many protesters had rallied on Friday that the massive security forces\nwere eventually swamped. The crowds fought with their bodies and stones until the police ran\nout of steam and gave up.</p>\n\n<p>As we walked home with the sun setting, evidence of even more violent confrontations could\nbe seen: Fires were everywhere. In front of the city's main mosque, a row of police trucks\nburned. The office of the governorate and a ruling-party building were set on fire, as were\nmany police stations and vehicles. Rumors about protesters having been killed abounded.</p>\n\n<p>Egyptians in Alexandria did the unimaginable on Friday, fending off a police attack for the\nfirst time in their lives. They are walking around in shock, unable to digest the significance\nof what they have done. A few hours ago, everyone was saying: Now, the army will come. But it\nis no longer clear on whose side the army will intervene.

It was a day where everyone was\nupbeat and focused. It was a day of success. It was a day in which we saw Oakland step out to\nthe tune of tens of thousands of people to make a bold statement and raise awareness about\neconomic disparity. It was a solid shot in the arm that the Occupy Movement needed. It was a\ngood look, something that Oakland needed.</p>\n\n<p>The goals of the day were to shut down the businesses in downtown, in particular the banks\nand, later that afternoon, march to the Port of Oakland, the 5th largest in the country, and\nshut it down as well.</p>\n\n<p>Many thought this was a far-fetched dream and an impossible task. After all, there have\nbeen several attempts to do this in the recent past without a whole lot of success, but when a\ncrowd numbering by some estimates between 15-20 thousand showed up ready to put in work, that\ndream became a reality. The shut down of the port lasted until the next morning where you\nstill had hundreds of 99%ers down there blocking the gates and not letting trucks pass\nthrough. Eventually folks left at around 9 am that morning.</p>\n\n<p>That night, while leaving the port, I saw numerous veterans of past movements including\nformer Black Panther Chair Elaine Brown who was beaming with pride. Brown expressed how proud\nshe was to see today's younger generation rise to the occassion, take the baton and move the\nproverbial envelope in a significant way. A general strike being organized and pulled off\nwithin a week's time and the port being shut down was something she'd thought would never\nhappen, at least in her lifetime. For her seeing such a huge crowd come out to support was\nmoving.</p>\n\n<br />\n<b>A Great Day in Oakland</b><br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>The General Strike started out with the first of several scheduled gatherings at 9am on the\ncorner of 14th and Broadway. When I arrived, there was already a crowd numbering in the\nhundreds, perhaps even a thousand or so, with speakers already on the mic explaining the goals\nof the day, what the General Strike was about. Traffic for several blocks up and down Broadway\nhad been stopped and the streets closed down. Liberating that corner was the first of the\nday's many victories.</p>\n\n<p>The stage and loud-speaker system on 14th &amp; Broadway was one of several locations\nspawning activity. Inside Oscar Grant Plaza (city hall plaza) where the General Assemblies are\nheld there were large crowds who were engaged by dozens of other speakers and performers.\nThere was also a number of art displays. The vibe in the air was infectious, as many could\nsense this was the beginning of what many felt would be an historic day. The next gatherings\nscheduled to take place were 12 noon and 2pm, with the last one scheduled at 5pm, when folks\nwould march to shut down the Port of Oakland.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day all sorts of speakers blessed the mic, speaking to pressing issues,\nespecially how the economy was impacting them and their communities. There were heartfelt\nperspectives shared by various members of Black, Brown, Asian and Native communities along\nwith students, labor and working class folks.</p>\n\n<p>The list of those addressing the crowd is too long to accurately recount, but everyone from\nAngela Davis to former Black Panther Melvin Dixon, to labor leaders, like Clarence Thomas,\nTopaz DuBois and Jack Heyman, to artists like Boots Riley and Mistah Fab, were up in the mix\nspeaking truth to power.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the economy, other topics addressed included how banks facilitated the\nmassive numbers of foreclosures in Black, Brown and now working class communities. We learned\nhow banks like Wells Fargo invest in immigrant detention centers and private prisons. We also\nheard folks speak about the current California prison hunger strike and how mass incarceration\nis economically benefiting stakeholders within the prison industrial complex.</p>\n\n<p>We heard Iraq War vets speak to the exorbitant amounts of money used by the military to\nfurther meaningless wars and how those funds should be reinvested in our communities to\nimprove schools. The city of Oakland closed 5 schools last week with more to come. That was a\nmain point echoed throughout the day. Police violence that brought about the last General\nStrike 1934 (Bloody Thursday) . Police protected the 1% back in those days as well.</p>\n\n<p>We heard folks speak passionately about the plight of farmers and how big agribusiness has\nbeen impacting the 99%. There was a lot of talk about the environment, food justice and how\nMonsanto has been a tyrannical business crippling small farmers and entire countries by\nobtaining patents for seeds and forcing everyone to buy from them.</p>\n\n<p>There was lots of conversation about electoral politics, with many of the speakers making\nit very clear time and time again that the Occupy Movement is not a springboard for either the\nRepublican or Democratic Party. Many of the speakers, as well as many we've interviewed in the\ncrowd, had concluded that much of the leadership in both parties have been brought off and are\nin the pockets of Wall Street lobbyists. Elected officials were not allowed to speak via the\nstage yesterday and that was fine by many in attendance. No one wanted to hear a stomp speech\nor apologies for the way their respective parties have been complicit in propping up big banks\nand carrying out their agendas.</p>\n\n<p>In response to Wall Street corrupting politicians, over the past couple of weeks we've met\nand heard from a number of young people here in Oakland who are quietly networking, planting\nseeds and gearing up to run for a number of local offices come 2012 and 2013. That has been a\nbright spot.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day we heard local singers and rappers take the stage and speak or do\nremakes of popular songs where the theme was economic disparity. For, example we heard one\nsister redo Gloria Gaynor's classic 'I Will Survive' where she sung about the banks.. It was a\nbeautiful thing.</p>\n\n<p>Artists like Richie Rich, D-Sharp, Dwayne Wiggins, Flo, Jennifer Johns, Sellasie, Walt 427,\nPicaso of Living legends, Ashe, Brwn Bflo, Mistah Fab and of course Boots Riley and Cat who\nheld down one of the stages were among the scores of artists on hand supporting the General\nStrike. Music played throughout the afternoon and could be heard throughout the plaza, up and\ndown Broadway. Songs by Dead Prez and James Brown helped them became familiar voices during\nyesterday's rally.</p>\n\n<p>With each scheduled gathering folks would march off by the hundreds to different parts of\nthe downtown. One group went before the Office of University California to protest fee hikes\nwhich have doubled in the past two years. Some went to the library to protest budget cuts\nresulting in it being shut down.</p>\n\n<p>Others went to stand before the banks and demand they shut down. There was a large group\nthat went and sat in front of Citibank. Still others went to Chase Bank while others went to\nBank of America. In all those instances we heard or saw that the banks closed their doors.\nThis was a beautiful thing.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the plaza were numerous tables with folks passing out information from a variety\nof organizations. If you needed help with foreclosures, legal aid, There were places set up\nwhere posters of the Occupy were being made? There was also lots of food.. Big shout out to\nthe unions and Everett and Jones BBQ for feeding over 5 thousand people that day?The mood\nthroughout the day was upbeat as many were happy to see so many had come together and a\nGeneral strike which once seemed like an impossibility was actually taking place. Police\npresence in and around downtown was minimal.</p>\n\n<p>What I witnessed yesterday was the ultimate town square where everyone came together and\nthrough this exercise of having an open mic on 14th and Broadway all of us were able to bear\nwitness to each others concerns and stories..This is important to note for a couple of\nreasons. First, for years we've had folks from various communities addressing economic\ndisparity only to be ignored or have their voices minimize and marginalized. I spoke at length\nabout this in yesterday's blog.. You can access it</p>\n\n<a\nhref=\"http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2011/11/02/oaklands-general-strike-lets-not-forget-what-caused-this/\"\n target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>Second, this was important because it clearly showed how lazy many in the corporate media\nhad been in terms of explaining what the Occupy Movement has been about.. Claims of it being\nunfocused and having no agenda was the convenient 30 second sound bite hawked vs simply\nexplaining that financial institutions have hit large segments of the population in different\nways resulting in folks coming together, comparing notes, raising awareness and trying to and\nfiguring out the best ways to smash back on a common enemy (Wall Street Banks). This is what\nNov 2 2011 spelled out and reaffirmed for many.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Importance of the Labor and Shutting Down the Port</b></p>\n\n<p>Throughout the day we heard from all sorts of union folks. We got important history lessons\non the labor movement from long time activists and union members like Jack Heyman of the\nlongshoremen and Clarence Thomas of ILWU Local 10. We also got to understand why so many\nunions are currently under attack by 1% interests and how that would ultimately impact the\nfolks in the crowd.</p>\n\n<p>Many union members spoke to the history of the General Strikes. They talked about some of\nthe parallels back in 1934 and today in terms of 1% interests trying to crap on the average\nworker.</p>\n\n<p>We were given a firm understanding about the Port of Oakland and what it meant when you\nshut it down. We learned that for each day it's shut down it delays goods being delivered up\nto a week. Three days of shut down equals 3 weeks of delay. With each day the port is shut\ndown they lose up to $8 million dollars. With that information at hand folks got the picture.\nShutting down the Port of Oakland would be directly messing with the money of some very\npowerful people, thus lines in the sand were being clearly drawn.</p>\n\n<p>This picture was further cemented when it was explained who actually gets that $8 million\nand where that money is used. It was clear that the folks in economically depressed West\nOakland where the port sits, or the 99% gathered yesterday at 14th and Broadway, were not main\nbeneficiaries. Oakland rap artist Boots Riley and labor leader Clarence Thomas gave an\nimportant overview of what the day was supposed to be like on Democracy Now.</p>\n\n<p>For many, the Port of Oakland was a major battle ground with long-lasting scars. Very few\nforgot what took place 8 years ago, April 7th 2003, when police shot rubber bullets at\nanti-war protestors who attempted to shut down the port. Several protesters were seriously\ninjured. Hence, going back to the port, with all the key issues the Occupy Movement had\nbrought up, was paramount.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GdzuzQKs8M\" target=\"_blank\">You can peep the video of\nthat HERE</a>.<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>By 4 pm that afternoon all sides of the plaza were packed with thousands in the streets\naround 14th and Broadway as folks geared up for the march to shut down the Port of Oakland.\nThe first wave of people left and headed down to the Port of Oakland. That's the image that\nmany of local news stations showed. They said this was about 7 thousand, but most protesters\nfeel this was a deliberate and gross under counting.</p>\n\n<p>By 5pm another huge crowd had gathered, even larger then the first, being that it had been\nannounced for the past week that the Port March would start at that time. By the time you got\ndown to the Port, there were folks for as far as the eye could see. From my own estimation the\ncrowd was easily over 15k and maybe more. It was by far one of the largest gatherings I had\nseen in Oakland and one of the largest we've seen in the Bay Area in a long time.</p>\n\n<p>It was a sea of people that took up both sides of the bridge/overpass leading to the port\nthat would not stop. For many seeing this huge turnout was the crowning jewel to what had been\na great day and an eventful week that saw the Occupy Movement rebound from a night of chaos\nand police repression just a week earlier. When word got out that the Port had been shut down,\neveryone was excited. Cars honked, trucks honked? Many truckers came and used their vehicles\nto help block port entrances so no one could enter.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Violence and the Lessons behind It</b></p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, throughout the day there were numerous marches with the intention of\nshutting down banks and other businesses that were part of the 1% and bringing awareness to\ntroubled social programs and services hard hit by the economy. It was during one of these\nmarches (the March Against Capitalism) that we got word of the first acts of vandalism.</p>\n\n<p>We heard and later saw video of a group of masked men dressed in black, spray painting the\nword \"Strike\" across the front of Whole Foods grocery store. Later on these same masked men\nbroke the windows to Wells Fargo and Chase and tagged the walls. This enraged many on were on\nthe scene, not because they felt sorry for the banks who would and did quickly repair the\ndamage, but because they felt that what took place was a deliberate attempt to undermine what\nthe General Strike was about. They also felt acts of vandalism were also gonna further soil\nthe city's reputation and give light to the stereotype of us being a crime ridden city.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, for the past week the police had kept their distance, thus many felt\ncomfortable in attending activities around the General Strike. You had families with kids. You\nhad many who were undocumented who were out and about, who suddenly had their safety and\nwell-being put into jeopardy by a handful of folks who apparently had no regard for what the\nOccupy Oakland General Assembly had called for, which was demonstrations free of\nvandalism.</p>\n\n<p>Many stepped to the vandals, urging them to stop. A couple even had physical\nconfrontations.</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=86XhCwHhwn8\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Here's a video of the confrontation at Whole Foods.</a><br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>Some have attempted to explain this away by saying Whole Foods was vandalized because the\nmanagement had threatened to fire workers if they took off to attend the General Strike.\nOthers were saying that the violence and vandalism is small potatoes compared to the economic\nviolence done by the big banks, big corporations and their cronies.</p>\n\n<p>As one gentleman remarked upon hearing the news: \"Yes, windows got broke, but Wells Fargo\nand Bank of America broke hearts, broke the economy and on top of that stole people's homes? A\nwindow breaker will go to jail while a CEO who swindles us out of our homes and billions of\ndollars is free and might even be sitting at the highest levels of government\".</p>\n\n<p>In short F$%K a Bank.</p>\n\n<p>There's not too many who would argue with that sentiment and many didn't as the day\ncontinued on and we saw a successful shut down of the port. But at the same time many weren't\nbuying the line that violence was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>After the march to the port, many went home and retired for the night only to wake up the\nnext morning to discover that Occupy Oakland made national news. Sadly, it was not for the\nsuccess of the General Strike or the shut down of the port, but for vandalism and\nviolence.</p>\n\n<p>Many waking up to the news of overnight violence were stunned, angry, and dismayed. Damn\nnear every corporate news outlet was on the scene, including the NY based Today Show, who had\npretty much ignored Occupy Oakland in the past, but this morning they had a reporter on the\nscene doing live coverage. Blaring across everyone's screens wasn't 20k people closing down\nthe 5th largest port in the country, it was masked men wearing all Black setting fires in the\nmiddle of the street and destroying local businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Tully's is right next to occupy oakland and was a supporter of the movement.</p>\n\n<p>Many protesters were extremely upset when her shop was vandalized.</p>\n\n<p>Many of shops hit were ones friendly and supportive of Occupy Oakland, including Tully's\nCoffee on 14th and Broadway who had her windows smashed. Spray paint marred damn near every\nbuilding around the plaza and up and down Broadway. Oakland police who had had kept their\ndistance from Occupy Oakland for the past few days showed up in full riot gear, shooting tear\ngas and flash grenades. Much of the violence took place around 2 am, and by 4 am, when over\n100 people were arrested, the overwhelming majority of those sent to jail (75% ) were from\nout-of-town.</p>\n\n<p>In the aftermath of the violence, many were left with a very clear lesson as to what Occupy\nOakland and the Occupy Movement in general is up against. Folks know beyond a shadow of a\ndoubt that any and all attempts will be made to marginalize, discredit and ultimately erase\nany success stories this movement has.</p>\n\n<p>When this movement does well or accomplishes a goal, one should expect there will be some\nsort of incident to sabotage things. On the heels of that incident will be gaggle of corporate\nreporters on hand complete with satellite trucks ready to convey any and all dirty details\nthey can dig up. The end game is to spark fear and plant seeds of doubt.</p>\n\n<p>Huge crowds coming out to shut down the Port of Oakland was lost to the deliberate\ndestruction of local businesses</p>\n\n<p>As I noted in the past, this is a war being fought on many fronts. Information, News\nNarratives and PR are 3 of them.Occupy Oakland's shutting down the Port and having a large\nturnout for a General Strike was major. It was a huge smack in the face to the 1% who have\nbeen doing everything they could to dismiss the Occupy Movement. Unfortunately for the 1%,\nwhat took place on November 2nd was something you could not ignore.</p>\n\n<p>If that wasn't enough, on the same day we shut down the port of Oakland, Occupy Wall Street\nheld a People's Tribunal in Zuccotti Park where they found Goldman Sachs guilty. Folks from\nOWS directly confronted executives from Goldman Sachs where they handed them the guilty\nverdict.</p>\n\n<p>Occupy Oakland helped clean up and stood by broken windows to help deter further damage by\nthose bent on destroying the Occupy Movement.</p>\n\n<p>These activities were supposed to be the main conversation. Victories on both coasts for\nthe Occupy Movement with everyone gearing up for Bank Transfer Day on Saturday Nov 5th. I\nguess from the stand point of the 1% Financial Bankers, the momentum had to be slowed\ndown.</p>\n\n<p>That slowdown was gonna come in the form of broken windows and all out vandalism. This was\nsomething Occupy Oakland had avoided for 3 weeks since they first set up shop. Even during the\npolice melee from the other week with all the flash bombs and tear gas, no one ran around\nbusting windows. To see this happening on the night of big success is more than obvious.</p>\n\n<p>So as frustrating and dismaying as it was, we all know what this was about - an attempt to\ncrush the spirit. We've all seen this film before?most recently in Cairo, Egypt during the\nArab Spring.</p>\n\n<p>If folks recall, days after the protest began, out of the blue 'some people' decided to go\nloot the national Egyptian Museum. Initially our corporate media tried to blame the protesters\nin Tahir Square. They were quick to sour on them and attach demeaning labels to them. The\nprotesters in Egypt realized what was happening, quickly regrouped, stood side by side locking\narms to guard the museum. Later it was discovered that it was agents working for Mubark's\nsecret police thugs, who were attempting to sway world wide opinion by posing as looters.</p>\n\n<p>Could that have been the case here in Oakland? After all, it's an an age-old tactic that\neven Stevie Wonder could see from a distance. It happens all over within various movements by\nthose desperate to hold onto power. From the days of Cointel-Pro to now in the age of\nincreased surveillance and the Patriot Act, how could one NOT draw such conclusions when the\nactions taken are destructive?</p>\n\n<p>It's good that folks from Occupy Oakland responded immediately to the carnage by helping\nclean up the damage and guarding shops that had broken windows, to prevent looting. Such\ngestures have been uplifting and underscore the resilience that people in this city have?</p>\n\n<p>Nov 2 2011 we saw tens of thousands of people from all walks of life shut down the Port of\nOakland costing those in power, millions of dollars and we have folks breaking the windows of\nlocal businesses in Oakland of all places.. Think on that for a minute..Why not bring that\nruckus to the doorsteps of the bankers who've wrecked havoc on us? Aptos? Hillsdale? Menlo\nPark?</p>\n\n<p>The day is coming where it's not gonna be so easy to find folks to be agents for the 1%.\nUntil then lets recognize things for what they are.. Call a spade a spade or in this case,\ncall a guy busting out windows of local businesses wearing all black- A provocateur- perhaps a\nhired goon to be an ally to the 1%. He's the Oakland style version of the white shirted police\nwe see on Wall Street.</p>\n\nThis form needs Javascript to display, which your browser doesn't support.\n\nWe Are the 99% -- Occupy Wall St. and Beyond \n\n<strong>Anne-Marie Cusac</strong>  | In Ohio, thanks to John Kasich, state parks now welcome\noil and gas companies.\n\nDavid Barsamian <strong></strong> | \"We're always trying to find ways that we can disturb\npower,\" says the co-founder of Code Pink.\n\n| The Republican State Leadership Committee has played a key role in the party's recent\nsuccesses.\n\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h1>Occupy Wall Street Has the Establishment Freaked Out</h1>\n</div>\n\n<h1>On Tuesday alone 18 arrests were made in the Assembly gallery, including that of\nProgressive editor Matthew Rothschild.

The weather was typically British: gloomy\nclouds emitting intermittent drizzles - fitting, I daresay, for a peace demonstration.<br />\n<br />\nI entered Trafalgar Square, and was immediately harassed by a young Canadian man carrying a\ndark green flag. My friend asked him, \"I noticed you're flying Gaddafi's flag - do you support\nhim?\" The Canadian, who later told us he is from Charlottetown, simply answered, \"I do.\" This\nshocked us tremendously, for who would support a dictator known for his infamous <a\nhref=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2030931/Libya-Inside-Gaddafis-torture-chamber-The-bloodstained-cells-inside-primary-school-used-brutalise-enemies.html\">\ntorture chambers</a> and suppression of human rights? We pressed the pro-Gaddafi fellow\nfurther, and he replied \"Gaddafi is fighting NATO, and NATO is my enemy.\"<br />\n<br />\nNATO is, without a doubt, an imperialist organization, but the doctrine \"the enemy of my enemy\nis my friend\" is likewise dangerous. Both Gaddafi and NATO are, after all, creatures of\nviolence.<br />\n<br />\nThinking the Charlottetonian was in a minority of one, I looked at him square in the eyes and\nsaid \"Well, you have the right to free speech, but I just don't agree with you.\" He tramped\naway, a cruel grin on his face.<br />\n<br />\nYet he was not alone in his beliefs. As we walked deeper into the square, more green flags\ncaught our attention. When I asked one of those protesters, a Communist Party member, about\nthe irony of Gaddafi support at an anti-war rally, he proclaimed, in true totalitarian\nfashion, that only violence engenders progress in human history. I reminded him that Mussolini\nhad said the exact same thing, and then asked for his thoughts on Gandhi. He replied, \"Gandhi\ndid nothing for India.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe day went by, with stirring speeches from Tony Benn, Bruce Kent, and Julian Assange. At\n4PM, we began the march to Downing Street. I was embarrassed and infuriated to be marching\nalongside Gaddafi supporters, most of whom were white and had probably never even stepped foot\ninside an Arab dictatorship. I was dying a little on the inside.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, as we approached Number 10, my spirits were lifted. A small yet vocal group of Arab\nprotesters was gathered outside, chanting \"Free free Syria, down down Assad! Free free Yemen,\ndown down Saleh! Free free Libya, down down Gaddafi!\" These protesters, clearly, knew what\nthey were protesting against: their friends and relatives have no doubt suffered under\noppressive regimes.<br />\n<br />\nI attended the Stop the War protest because I oppose the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and\nSomalia. I came away feeling considerable shame about the minority of anti-war protesters who\nchoose to support lesser evils, instead of opposing evil altogether. Overall, however, I came\naway with hope; if the Arab Spring can overthrow dictators and tyrants in the Middle East,\nperhaps we can overthrow our oppressors in the West and institute a freer and fairer system of\ngovernance, free from the Obamas, Gaddafis, and Goldman Sachs's of the world.</div>"], ["VQR ?

(Elliott D. Woods / Redux)</p>\n\n<p>After an unsettling ride into town on Friday morning, February 4, I dropped off my bags at\nmy hotel and headed to Tahrir Square for the afternoon. I hopped a cab from the north end of\nZamalek to the Qasr El-Nil Bridge, which all of my friends told me would be the easiest entry\npoint. The Sixth of October Bridge-the most obvious entry point to Tahrir Square-was a red\nzone on the map as far as I was concerned. Two days before, the bridge had been a flash point\nfor violence between Mubarak's thugs and anti-government protesters, who hid behind corrugated\niron barricades and defended themselves with rocks and cobblestones dug up from the streets\nand sidewalks around Tahrir.</p>\n\n<p>A pair of Egyptian tanks had the entrance to the Qasr El-Nil Bridge sealed off, and two\nlong lines of protesters were working their way past soldiers performing ID checks and\npat-downs. The mood at the bridge was relaxed, and no one seemed to notice the arrival of a\nforeigner toting a camera bag.</p>\n\n<p>When I got to the front of the line, I showed my passport and opened my bag, and the\nsoldier checking me shuttled me on through without so much as a question. By that point, the\nmilitary's senior command had already issued a statement saying that the Egyptian army would\nnot use force to put down the protests. The protesters had made an early effort to embrace the\narmy-with chants like \"el-geish wa el-nass fi waheda,\" or \"the army and the people are\none\"-and it appeared successful. Were it not for the tanks, riot helmets and machine guns, the\nprotesters bedecked in Egyptian flag-colored headbands and face paint would have seemed like\nhopped-up sports fans on their way into a home game.</p>\n\n<p>When I reached the other side of the bridge, I saw a burned out truck and rows of\nconcertina wire spread the street, guarded by a line of soldiers in riot gear. I crammed\nmyself into a human funnel several hundred people thick, and the crowd slowly pushed me along\nthrough the last military ID check. It was in the roiling crowd that I heard protest chants\nfor the first time, among them the signature \"As-Shaab youreed asqaat el-nizam!\" which means,\n\"The people want to bring down the regime!\"</p>\n\n<p>As I elbowed my way to the checkpoint with the rest of the sweating, chanting mass, I also\nheard the first of many off-putting remarks that would continue throughout the following week.\nI had been chatting with two men squished behind me when I heard a woman's voice say, \"I\nrecommend that you don't speak Arabic.\" The voice belonged to a young woman, unveiled, looking\nfashionable and only mildly flustered as her boyfriend or brother tried to keep her from\ngetting crushed.</p>\n\n<p>\"Why?\" I asked.</p>\n\n<p>\"It makes people suspicious to hear a foreigner speaking Arabic. People know there are a\nlot of Israelis who speak Arabic, and they might think you are Israeli.\"</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't the first time I'd come across that idea. I was sorry to hear it again, though\nnot surprised-Egyptian state media had been pumping the population full of bile about how\nforeign intervention was responsible for all of the protests, and about how foreign\njournalists were really undercover agents provocateurs. Mubarak's state TV had so successfully\nscrambled the country's brains over the decades that the very protesters calling for freedom\nfrom censorship, among other things, were unable to tune out the state's lies more than a week\ninto the revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Mubarak was so desperate to control the messages coming into and out of Egypt in the second\nweek of protests that he forced the country's mobile and Internet service providers to shut\ndown. The government also closed Al Jazeera's Cairo bureau, arrested a slew of the channel's\nemployees, and launched a smear campaign to convince the Egyptian people that Al Jazeera was a\npropaganda mill bent on the destruction of the state. (A doorman in my neighborhood asked me\nif I'd heard that Al Jazeera said Omar Suleiman-Mubarak's newly appointed VP and lifetime\nright-hand man-had died. \"He's not dead! He is alive! You see how Al Jazeera lies!\")</p>\n\n<p>In a brilliant stroke, Al Jazeera responded to the government shutout by offering their\nstream for free to any satellite channel that wanted to run it. Instead of one channel showing\nlive feeds from the square and giving face-time to angry protesters, there were fifty.</p>\n\n<p>Mubarak's attempts to cut off Egyptians from the world and from each other backfired.\nRather than forcing them into the dark, Mubarak forced them into the street-the only place\nwhere they could satisfy their curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>I passed through the final ID check and entered into a tunnel of clapping protesters who\nwere chanting \"Raise your head! You're Egyptian!\" And even though I am not Egyptian, the\nspirit was contagious. I've seen a handful of protests in my life, from Hamas parades through\nthe streets of Gaza City to labor protests right here in Cairo, but nothing I had ever seen\ncomes anywhere close the scale of Tahrir Square.</p>\n\n<p>The name Tahrir Square is misleading in the sense that there's really nothing square about\nit. There is a traffic circle at the center, and the perimeter is flanked by the salmon-hued\nEgyptian Museum, at the edge closest to the Nile River, and the Mugamma at the other end, a\ncrescent-shaped concrete behemoth where Egyptians have to go to apply for just about\neverything, from passports to marriage certificates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Egyptian protesters gathered in Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square.\n(Elliott D. Woods / Redux)</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, February 4, there were packs of protesters clustered from one end of Tahrir to\nthe other. There was an air of festival, with several stages going on simultaneously; you\ncould listen to a sheikh from Al Azhar delivering an uplifting sermon, or you could walk fifty\nmeters and get into a passionate call and response with a leader of the Facebook revolution.\nHundreds of people walked around with bandages on their heads and faces from the fighting two\ndays prior, but there was to be no fighting that Friday-or on any subsequent days, for that\nmatter. By February 4, with outside agitation having disappeared as quickly as it flared up,\nthe revolution had become truly peaceful.</p>\n\n<p>As journalists filmed and photographed, they were filmed and photographed in turn by dozens\nof mobile phone-wielding citizen journalists. There were rumors that the Egyptian secret\npolice were paying people to film westerners in Tahrir, but I doubt it. Shooting your own\ncell-phone video from Tahrir was the 2011 equivalent of snagging a chunk of the Berlin\nWall.</p>\n\n<p>* * *</p>\n\n<p>A composite sketch of an Egyptian taken from the thousands of faces at Tahrir Square would\nreveal a fascinating amalgamation: half sun-weathered, bearded, or shrouded in a full-face\nniqab; the other half fresh-faced, t-shirted, and sporting new Gucci sunglasses and a\nmanicure. While the West panicked about how the Muslim Brotherhood would capitalize on the\nchaos, a broad swathe of Egyptian society was literally rubbing shoulders in Tahrir Square as\npeers for the first time in more than half a century.</p>\n\n<p>A thirty-two-year-old psychologist named Fatima, the first streaks of white in her unveiled\nblack hair, made a plea for Americans to look at Tahrir and see a picture of a diverse and\nunited Egypt that defies stereotypes: \"We want to work, we want freedom of expression, we want\ndemocracy. We're Muslims and Christians, we all live together and we respect each other. We're\nvery misrepresented in the West, and our government is not a representation of who we are.\" I\nasked Fatima to tell me her dream for a future Egypt without Mubarak. \"I want to be able to\nwalk in the streets and be proud that I am free. I don't want to have to worry about the\npolice harassing me. I want to be able to vote, I want to understand my government, and I want\nto be part of the decision-making.\"</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fatima, thirty-two, an Egyptian psychologist, at Tahrir Square on\nFriday, February 4. (Elliott D. Woods for VQR)</p>\n\n<p>A crowd gathered around the spot where I was talking to Fatima, and everyone wanted their\nchance to say something to the camera. A hefty, dark-skinned Koran teacher named Allah\nMohammad, forty years-old, with a henna-dyed beard and a prominent zebiba-the forehead stain\nthat results from pressing one's head to the ground two hundred times a day in prayer-told me\nthat he had been imprisoned for twelve years without explanation. It's a common story in\nEgypt: kids as young as nine or ten snatched up from the mosque and locked up in secret jails\nwhere they are interrogated and tortured for years, never to go to trial, sometimes never to\nemerge. But Allah Mohammad made it a point that he did not come to Tahrir for religious\nreasons, or even to protest his imprisonment. He said he was protesting because hundreds of\nthousands of Egyptians were starving, unemployed, and desperate, and he blamed Mubarak's\nregime.</p>\n\n<p>Bread has been a metaphorical rally point for revolutions all over the world-it was a sharp\nrise in bread prices in 1789 that fired the indignation of French peasants for whom\nintellectual rhetoric held little sway-and Egypt is no different. In Egyptian Arabic, the word\nfor bread is \"aish,\" which is also a word for \"life.\" To keep the people satiated, the\ngovernment has subsidized state bakeries to keep the price of bread at about one penny per\npita-like loaf. So while double-digit inflation has ripped through the economy in recent years\nand doubled the prices for commodities like meat and sugar, the government could at least\nclaim to have kept the cost of \"life\" down; however, as one would expect in a country defined\nby systemic corruption, there is more to the story.</p>\n\n<p>Government dispensaries produce a limited supply of bread each day, and corrupt bakers sell\nbread in bulk to restaurant owners and street sellers who resell the bread at double the\nprice. Often people wait in bread lines hundreds of people deep only to get to the window and\nfind out the day's supply has run out. And so bread became an obvious anchor in the\nrevolutionary refrain, \"Aish, shoghl, wa horriya.\" Bread, work, and freedom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An Egyptian protester weeps as he prays in Tahrir Square. (Elliott\nD. Woods / Redux)</p>\n\n<p>Whatever fears I had when I set out for Tahrir were allayed immediately by the warm\nreception I found among protesters of all ages and backgrounds in the square. At one point, I\nclimbed atop an iron railing to photograph the surging crowds, and as I stood there I felt a\nhand tapping my ankle. I looked down to see a smiling man wearing the trademark red felt cap\nof an Al Azhar sheikh-in his outstretched hand he held a date-filled cookie called a maamoul.\nA few minutes later, I felt his hand again, and this time he was passing me a mango juicebox.\nBack in the crowd, dozens of voices wafted by saying things like \"thank you for supporting\nus,\" or, \"thank you for spreading our message.\"</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could say that my reception among the crowds was fully positive, but there had\nbeen too much violence and too much tension for everyone in Tahrir to offer a warm welcome. In\none instance, I was rebuked by a group of young women who approached as I was filming an\ninterview with a man who had just finished praying.</p>\n\n<p>\"What are you doing here?\" one of the young women shouted, scowling and pointing a finger\nin my face.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm a journalist,\" I replied.</p>\n\n<p>\"What is your nationality?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"American.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Why are you really here?\" she shrieked, seething, her voice shaking with anger. \"How do we\nknow you're really a journalist?\"</p>\n\n<p>Her invective grew, and eventually a crowd closed in on me. Voices rose all around me; some\ncalled for her to back off, others yelled for me to show my passport and prove that I was an\nAmerican and a journalist.</p>\n\n<p>\"Foreign countries have interfered in Egypt's affairs for too long,\" she yelled, \"and now\nwe are not asking for anyone's help. We do not need you here. We do not want you here. We\nrespectfully ask you to please leave the square.\"</p>\n\n<p>I respectfully turned and ducked out of the mob, knowing there was no point in arguing, but\nI didn't tuck tail and leave the square. Nor did I believe that the majority of the tens of\nthousands of Egyptians gathered in Tahrir would support her request. Still, I could easily see\nher point. I had seen a poster that day with Mubarak's presidential portraits chronologically\naligned with every president from Reagan onward, and I knew as well as anyone else that three\ndecades of Mubarak's dictatorship would not have been possible without political and financial\nsupport from the United States-at an annual cost of about $1.5 billion taxpayer dollars in\nrecent years. Even Obama studiously avoided the ejection button until the end. In pursuit of\nAmerican objectives in the Middle East-namely the easy access to energy resources and the\nprotection of Israel-we have invested in dictators who happily repress unpleasant elements in\ntheir own countries (democratic activists as much as Islamists) and promise not to raise a\nfuss over Israel's atrocious human rights violations. After all, wouldn't that be a case of\nthe pot calling the kettle black? Our dictator-dependent strategy is well-known to people in\nthis part of the world-and it does much more than provoke anger. It provokes a powerful\nfeeling of betrayal.</p>\n\n<p>How, on the one hand, can we claim to fight for democracy in places like Iraq and\nAfghanistan-at a cost of thousands of American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan\nlives-and then turn our backs on places like Egypt, where peaceful activists have been\nstruggling for democratic rights for decades?</p>\n\n<p>I strolled away from the crowd that had enveloped me, leaving my antagonist and her friends\narguing with a group of my defenders. Several young men trailed behind me, trying to reassure\nme. \"Don't worry,\" they said. \"Everything is okay.\" Within minutes I had another group of\nprotesters surrounding me, eager to record their statements to the world. Some spoke in\nEnglish, one spoke in French, and many spoke in Arabic. I filmed a half-dozen of them, and\nwhether they were bearded or dressed in jeans and sneakers, they all said more or less the\nsame things: \"We want our dignity. We want to be free.\"</p>\n\nThe Virginia Quarterly Review<br />\nOne West Range, Box 400223<br />"], ["Tear Gas & Homophobia: The Serbia Riots - Belgrade, Serbia Travel Blog", "http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/caseygcrosbie/1/1286387828/tpod.html", "TravelPod.com TravelStream? ?

And it's been a lesson in how messy\nfighting for civil rights and recognition can be.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nSaying the event that was was held was a \"march\" is a bit of a misnomer. In preparation for\nthe day, the police secured a few block radius between the train station and a local park, and\na majority of the event was a large rally held in a\n\n<br />\n<br />\nOutside of the zone, however, the packs of wolves circled. And unfortunately I was stuck\noutside with the wolves.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI left the hostel in the morning, asking a local police officer the safest way to get to the\nrally. He replied in broken English, \"Safe? There is no safe way.\" The officer suggested I\ninstead head out to the other side of town. Thanking him for his help, and went the opposite\ndirection he suggested. I looked back as I walked to see him and a few fellow officers\nwatching me go. I think they thought I was crazy for trying to get in.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAfter hearing news reports of where the masses of rioters were gathering, I decided to edge\naround to the other side of the protest area, hoping to sneak in through the back.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nBut I what I found instead were gangs out hunting. <br />\n<br />\n\nBelgrade's gay rights activists have been trying to hold marches for several years. The last\nrally held was over a decade ago. The responding violence from the parade was so great\nactivists held off organizing another for years. Last year they tried again. But there were so\nmany\n\n<i>threats</i> of violence that the march had to be canceled.<br />\n\n<br />\nThis year, they were not to be deterred. For the first time the activists garnered the full\npacking of the political parties, the police, and the even apparently the Serbian military.\nDepending on the report, some 4,000-6,000 police and Serbian soldiers were assigned to secure\nthe zone around where the rally, whose numbers were not more than 1000. Inside the rally, I\nhear, the protestors felt relatively safe.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nOutside, on the other hand...<br />\n<br />\nOne aspect of mob mentality is that once blood has begun to flow, some victimization HAS to\nhappen. If you can't take out your aggressions on the gay marchers themselves, go after the\npolice. If you can't get the police, go after banks and the political parties who sponsored or\nat least condoned the march, or anyone else who could be a reasonable scapegoat for your\nanger.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe mobs, being unable to find a way to get to the marchers, roved around the city looking for\neasy targets.\n\n  Coming back to my story, I came upon one such gang attempting to enter the back part of the\nsquare. 15-20 hooded figures with their ski-masks and baseball bats, throwing bricks at\npassing ambulances and police vehicles. I attempted to circumnavigate them, but they switched\ndirections and headed back down the street I was coming down, forcing me to take refuge in a\nlocal grocery as they passed.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI spent the next hour or so talking to locals about the riots. I found the usual spectrum of\nresponses to violent situations such as this- ranging from anger and fear of the protestors to\nanger at the gay rights activists for staging the rally and stirring up the negative\nsentiments. Normally I would have taken objection to that attitude, but being as I was a guest\nof the shop's hospitality I figured this was not the appropriate time for such as\nconfrontation.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nUpon leaving the shop, I weaved my way back towards my hostel finding that the masses of\nrioters had changed their locations several times, staging pitched battles and then fleeing.\nThe city was full of tear gas, burning trash bins, and broken windows where hooligans had\ntaken their anger out on car or bank windows.\n\n  <br />\nThis is about the time when the bombings started. Several times large explosions were heard in\nthe city, as rioters with Molotov cocktails set buildings, including the Democatic\nHeadquarters, on fire. One of the bombs went off just outside the hostel where I was staying,\nforcing several fellow hostelees (who had come out looking for food) to flee. I also have\nfootage of the largest mob of protestors as they swept through street below, being chased by\npolice.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI find the incident to be a great example of how much the LGBT movement is the civil rights\nmovement of our century. What is incredible about this rally is that it was not, say, on the\neve of a vote for marriage equality or some other major legislative action. These steps are\nyears away in Serbia. Instead, the activists here wanted nothing more than to show that there\nIS homosexuality in Serbia - and to be able to announce who they are. And even that much is\nseen as a threat to the conservatives. One of the local conservative groups dubbed the\nanti-gay protests \"A march of family people, for the defense of family.\" To be fair, I\nunderstand that a majority of the anti-gay crowd was not (or did not intend to be) violent.\nBut still, I can't help but to wonder how those same people justify their \"family event\"\nresulting in burning cars and bombed buildings. No buildings were burned by the pro-gay side.\nIt's perhaps the most ironic part of the conservative argument - to imply that our state is at\nrisk because of the 'cultural degradation\" caused by gays when their own militant groups are\nbombing government buildings in the name of protecting it. It shows that in the end, the\nrationalizations made are just covers for the root fear and hatred that lie underneath it.\n\nSerbia Travel Blogs (872)\n\n<h3 class=\"sub_title\">Get Travel Advice</h3>"], ["Ric the Shot - Amman, Jordan Travel Blog", "http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/ricduncombe/1/1302440805/tpod.html", "TravelPod.com TravelStream? ?

I managed a few minutes between the wind ruffling the\ncurtains of the bus into my face as we plodded our way, stopping briefly enough at a rest stop\nfor me to buy some M&amp;Ms and a much needed carton of milk which turned out to be yogurt and\nwas rather uncomfortable to drink in the morning heat.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe bus terminated at a rather lonely bus station on the outskirts of the city, so far out\nthat it seemed to be in the middle of nowhere but in fact, being on one of the cities many\nhills, it merely has the hex of being high on the horizon, masking the view of the huge city\nin its grasp. Fortunately a fellow passenger, a Japanese gentleman by the name of Mr Tanashi\nasked if I wanted to share a cab downtown. I had absolutely no idea where I was to be staying\nother than a business card from the Valentine Hotel for a place in Downtown\n\n<a href=\"/travel-blog-city/Jordan/Amman/tpod.html\" id=\"1/1302440805/geo/293986\"\nclass=\"text-enhance\">Amman</a> so I was welcome for both the company and half fare. My new\nfriend recommended I stay at a place called the Farah Hotel in downtown, he said it was very\nnice and had dorms. More importantly though he was also staying there and with no clue where\nanything was whatsoever in the city it seemed a good idea to put my entire trust in my new\nfriend.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAnd a good friend he proved to be, leading me to the Farah Hotel before departing to his room.\nThe dorms here are just 6JD per night and are pretty good with shared bathrooms (at least\nthree per floor) with hot and cold water and even Wi-Fi. The best part is they really are in\nthe center of downtown\n\n<a href=\"/travel-blog-city/Jordan/Amman/tpod.html\" id=\"1/1302440805/geo/293986\"\nclass=\"text-enhance\">Amman</a>, a short walk to almost anywhere. Keen to explore I immediately\ntook off and found myself walking along a main highway, from the taxi on my way in I had seen\na lot of street vendors selling clothing and shoes in what appeared to be a large open air\nmarket alongside the road. Keen to replace the Adidas trainers I had donated to the YES Hostel\nin Uganda with some smaller Converse-style shoes (I think that I could manage with just my\nboots and sandals but it would be nice to have some light comfortable shoes for everyday use)\nI thought this would be a great place to look and there were also huge stalls of fake football\nkits so I was also keen to see what I could find in that department.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe road took me past the Al-Husseini Mosque, the ancient hub of downtown which for a mosque\nlooks surprisingly accessible, no courtyard or grand opening, as attractive a building as it\nis, graced with dazzling minarets and a marble-like finish, it is quite content to have its\nentrance as just another part of the bustling street, like everything has almost grown around\nit like coral forming around a large anchor rock in the water. After twenty minutes or so of\nalmost repeated shops and small restaurants like some 1950s cartoon flashing across the scene,\nthe road split, I took the right-hand fork, I should have taken left. Although I found plenty\nof football shirts (they are fanatical Barcelona fans here) there were no shoes or other\nclothes to be seen but a short way up the road I did start to see a number of large bussed\ntrying to get up the road which had been sectioned off by a couple of armed police guards.\nAfter studying the buses I saw that they too were filled with armed police and just ahead of\nthem were other signs of unrest. Personnel carriers and soldiers had lined one of the side\nstreets, completely shutting it off, there were press vans, television cameras and a great\nthrong of people attempting to access whatever they were filming. It was another protest and a\nbig one at that.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe police had completely sealed off the entrance to the protest which looked like some sort\nof forum or public meeting place being a large paved circle surrounded by staircases which led\nto raised areas where people could sit and watch. It looked like they were being not strict\nbut rather careful about who was allowed to enter the area, I didn't think I stood a chance\nbut what I could do was at least soak up the atmosphere on this side of the fence.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI got back to the hotel as quickly as possible to get my camera and also quickly checked the\nnews, it seemed that the protesters were pro-government, against the changes in constitution\nand power approved by the King of Jordan, the previous Friday several people had been killed\nand hundreds injured in a similar rally at the same location, this was the second of two and\nwas supposed to be even bigger. I guess that explained the large police presence but I was\nsure as an outsider, behind the lines, I would be fine if everything got a bit out of control.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI got back to the protest half an hour later, pleased that it had not died down, in fact it\nhad got bigger, there were far more police here now, their white busses literally lined the\nclosed off street for a quarter mile, perhaps more. I would estimate at least a thousand were\nin the vicinity in some capacity or another with more seemingly coming off a perpetual\nproduction line of buses, their occupants looking scornfully out of the windows at the scene,\nsmoking a last cigarette before gearing up. It was like they were off to war.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nI hung around the outskirts looking down into the forum, grabbing a few shots of police\nwaiting to be called upon and the army standing in line but all the time I felt I was getting\ndrawn in to the dizzying mess of the entrance like the air around me was a rip current and I\nwas either unable or unwilling to walk parallel to its grasp and escape. The entrance was\nindeed a bustle of confusion, one person waved in and another pushed back by a riot\nshield-bearing officer but the majority seemed to be getting through and when I saw a couple\nof Jordanians inside taking photos I thought what the hell, and tried my luck. So sure I was\nof not getting through I think it may have actually helped, I must have had an air of calm\nabout me so when one of the police officers approached me and said 'Press?' I just said 'yes'\nand he waved me through. It was so simple! Had I just uncovered the solution of getting into\nanywhere in the world!?\n\n<br />\n<br />\nProbably not, but I was in and what an amazing experience it was.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAs I mentioned, this was a pro government protest so unlike the March 18th protests in Egypt\nwhere despite the goals of what was a minority on the day, the whole of\n\n<a href=\"/travel-blog-city/Egypt/Cairo/tpod.html\" id=\"1/1302440805/geo/294201\"\nclass=\"text-enhance\">Cairo</a> and even the country were euphoric in their revolution, this\nprotest had perhaps a bit more edge to it. Jordan has had no revolution and the people massing\nhere were very much going against the general feel of the country and as such there was\nperhaps more passion even than those chaotic scenes in Tahir Square. There was a large stage\nset up in front of a huge Jordanian flag where perhaps five hundred or so men were watching,\nshouting, cheering and clapping various speakers who yelled out patriotic sentences over a\nmicrophone. Behind these were the women, some fully dressed in the burka, others with their\nhair covered and some, more liberal dressed in western clothes but still standing in their\nassumed place some fifty feet from the men. Everywhere else there were people, most carrying\nJordanian flags, all moving, excited and with eyes full of anticipation.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nTheir were many journalists, some with cameras and others taking notes, three or four news\nbroadcasters were there too surrounded by a hundred or so people watching various hosts\ninterview outspoken youths and less partisan bystanders. I was briefly under the glare of the\ncamera myself, as the only westerner at the protest I seemed to attract a little attention. I\nremained my impartial best, 'Jordan is a wonderful country full of good people, it's an\nexciting time to be here'. Not Oscar worthy but if it made the news then perhaps I have done\nmy bit for British diplomacy, I just didn't want to say anything that would get someone\nkilled.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nAnd so this is how the afternoon continued, various speakers at the main stage attracted more\nattention than others, one even got at least a thousand people to link arms and dance, all\ncaptured on television and replayed on the nightly news for the entire country to see. More\nreporters appeared as the evening drew in, clearly expecting more trouble as there had been\nthe previous week they didn't even attempt to cover any of the political aspect of things\nhappening before their eyes. I guess that being stationed out here they see and have seen\nenough of that in the past three or four months. They were here for the violence though when\nit came I am not sure anyone managed to get any decent footage.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nIt was over in a flash, noise had been escalating from the main street behind the protest\nground, singing and chanting, it sounded like a football march before a big game or like one\nof those scenes from awful football hooligan movies. I rushed over across the plaza to get a\ncloser look only to be met with a wall of police. Holding my camera up in a vain attempt to\nget my press status to do me some good did nothing, they did not want our group anywhere near\nthis group. Murmurs around me were that they were anti-government protesters forming their own\nmarch to the plaza, the noise was enormous and all around me hundreds of police rushed to\nguard the main gate where I had gained my own access some hours ago. It was all a bit of a\nmess but I managed to squeeze my way through the barrage of police who were more concerned\nwith what was going on in front of them than behind. There was no real joy in this though,\nfinding my way behind yet more police, the ones I had earlier seen with riot shields and body\narmor. Through them I managed to see brief glimpses of the other protesters. They looked\nexactly like the ones behind me in the plaza, not being able to read the Arabic writing on\ntheir posters I would have had no idea that they had any different hopes and dreams than the\npeople I had been watching being interviewed earlier in the day.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe next ten minutes was actually about seven seconds in reality. The massed crowed, being\nforced back by the police in front of me started throw stones toward us, the guards raising\ntheir shields like Roman centurions to protect themselves. Suddenly shots were fired, from\nwhere I do not know or at who but they came from behind me and in an instant the massed crowd\nscattered, their feet kicking up dust in the\n\n<a href=\"/travel-blog-city/Jordan/Amman/tpod.html\" id=\"1/1302440805/geo/293986\"\nclass=\"text-enhance\">Amman</a> streets as they fled, dropping their banners and propaganda\nwhere they turned. Then it was over. Police regained composure and now turned back to me and\nthe other few who had confusingly strayed too far and asked, very politely, that we move back\nbehind the gates and rejoin the main protest which was still going on seemingly unaware of the\nevents just a few hundred meters away.\n\n<br />\n<br />\nThe thrill of those few seconds racing in my head made the peaceful scenes inside the main\nprotest seem rather tame when I returned. My camera had long since lost its battery but I\nstayed and watched as the sun came down and a few more speakers came and went, the crowd\ncontinuing to scream and shout. At about seven thirty the police mobilized again, circling the\nentire protest while officers requested that, after the final speaker had ended, that people\nbe on their way. The tight ring of armed police slowly began to walk forward, squeezing the\njuices of the protest out toward the gate. I managed to borrow a battery from a news\nphotographer at this point and get a few snaps but the general rule seemed to be for us to\nleave, fast. When everyone bar me and about six other news reporters had left and the policed\nring had closed on itself, we were given one last show of bravado as the entire force of\nofficers, well over a thousand composed themselves into ranks and began a series of marches\nand chants more like what I would associate with the army on parade than a police force out on\npatrol.\n\nQueen Noor Street, Shmeisani, PO Box 950629 Amman, Jordan\n\n<strong>Intercontinental Intercontinental Jordan Amman</strong>\n\n<span class=\"loc\">Islamic College Street Amman, Jordan</span>\n\n<span class=\"loc\">Hussein Bin Ali St., Jabal Amman, PO Box 831159 Amman, Jordan</span>\n\nKing Faisal Bin Abdul Azia, P.O.

Since there is ample analysis of what went on\nwithin the summit available to us all, I will try and briefly report back on my experience in\nthe lead up to the large Saturday march, the march itself and immediately afterwards. I\nattended the march, which was also the largest of the week's actions, with two comrades from\nthe Middle Tennessee branch of Solidarity and another comrade from Ohio who served as a street\nmedic during the mobilization.</p>\n\n<p>When we arrived in Toronto on Friday it was just in time for a poorly attended\nspokescouncil meeting at a community center near the downtown area. Instead of a spokescouncil\nthe meeting turned more or less into a briefing session for the 8-10 of us who had just\narrived in town. There was discussion of varying degrees of police harassment of small groups\nof young people throughout the city over the past few weeks. Apparently youth who \"fit the\nprofile\" of radicals had been harassed, detained, and in some cases even arrested for minor\nviolations like jaywalking and absurd accusations (in one circumstance a young Canadian man\nwas given a traffic ticket even though he was not in a car). We were told that there would be\nan attempt to lead a break-off from the march in order to reach the security perimeter the\nnext day, and there were instructions on how to find this contingent.</p>\n\n<p>The next day we walked to the march from the collective house we were staying in through\nsome pretty nasty weather. In spite of the downpour, there seemed to be tens thousands\ngathered at the convergence point, Queen's Park. Upon arriving we met up with one of the\norganizers who facilitated the spokescouncil meeting the night before, and she informed us\nthat the break off march was cancelled. We later discovered this was because a large\ncontingent that was supposed to provide the backbone of that march (including some from the\nblack bloc) had been preemptively trapped on Spadina Street, a good distance from the\nconvergence space.</p>\n\n<p>After much confusion the march began; from my vantage point I had no way of knowing where\nthe march began and ended, furthermore I had been told there were smaller feeder marches\nplanning to join the larger action later on the route. I could tell from my previous\nexperience at large immigrant rights and antiwar rallies -and the G20 in Pittsburgh- there\nwere well over 10,000 present, however, beyond that I had no clue. There were many contingents\nfrom organizations I was unfamiliar with-as they were of course Canadian-but I was excited to\nsee a variety of Marxist groups with extensive contingents of youth, including one group which\napparently had some kind of relationship to the black bloc as they served as a rallying point\nfor the bloc to march alongside- in addition to speaking out in defense of the bloc's actions.\nThey were also the group that lit a flare which most believe was a signal for the black bloc\nto break off from the main march.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows the course of events that took place once the main march got close to the\nsecurity fence: a group of 100 or so black bloc protestors moved rapidly down Queen and Bay\nstreets, down 20 or more blocks, with no police harassment; contrary to attempts by riot\npolice during the main march to trap the bloc on side streets. Once they had gained momentum\naway from the rest of the march the break-off protesters began smashing windows of\nmultinational corporations (they did mindfully skip local businesses, something I had not seen\nin Pittsburgh) as well as smashing police cars. Only two of the four or so actually had police\ninside them, but the bloc let the police leave before dismantling and burning the vehicles,\nwhile some police cars were left unattended- to block off streets. As we marched there were\nsparse lines of riot cops blocking a few side streets; both perceived pre-emptive strikes to\nkeep the unpermitted march somewhat contained.</p>\n\n<p>After the fires were lit, several thousand more demonstrators broke off from the main march\nto approach two of the burning cars-presumably out of curiosity. Meanwhile, hundreds of riot\npolice began pouring onto the side streets to push the people out of the area away from the\nsecurity fence, and effectively trapping several hundred protestors in the intersection where\ntwo cop cars continued to burn. This time had been enough for thousands more to gather,\nchanting \"Let Us Through!\" as they surrounded the small number of riot police. I climbed on\nstreet lights and other objects to get a better vantage point, and so roughly I would say\nthere were at least three or four thousand present. At one point, the riot police were even\nsurrounded, they backed up, and there was a feeling among many of us that there might be some\nmass action to push to the fence. The crowd however seemed opposed in principle to any active\nconfrontation with the noticeably restrained and nervous looking riot police. After several\nhours, our group of four retreated from the area to begin the long trek home, to find out the\ncity had almost entirely been shut down- metro lines were stopped, buses weren't running and\nmany streets remained blocked off. We heard that the remnants of that area were swept by the\nriot police shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<p>What happened immediately after was what we had been expecting all day: the crackdown. Once\na significant number of demonstrators were off the streets, the riot police began sweeping\npeople in the dozens. In Queens Park, the designated assembly zone for a legal rally, the riot\npolice assaulted people with batons, gas, and even rubber bullets. Several collective houses\nwere raided across the city and a heavy police presence appeared outside the Toronto Community\nMobilization Network Convergence Center. We got word that the evening's events were cancelled\nand that all of the Mobilizaiton Network organizers had been arrested (the Toronto Star the\nnext day would relay a message from the police force that they had in fact infiltrated the\ngroup). We stayed in our collective house that night, fearing to go outside as people would\ncome in and out of the house with terrifying stories of events that had transpired in the\ndarkness. There was extensive harassment of young people in general and supposedly there were\nareas of the city where searches were conducted at every block. During these searches (and\nlater we found out in the detention center as well) there were numerous accounts of sexual\nharassment and assault by the police forces. I myself heard several stories, including one\nfrom an apolitical young lady who was searched near the downtown area and touched\ninappropriately by a police officer.</p>\n\n<p>There were also reports that the police officers appeared to be on amphetamines by quite a\nfew people over the course of the night. We stayed in touch with a large group from the\nAnticapitalist Convergence which was conducting some kind of sit-in at a hotel in the city: we\nstayed on the phone to an international student who feared deportation upon arrest for the\nbetter part of an hour as he described how the police negotiated the arrest of the group, but\nlater stormed in with gas and batons to brutalize the group which had understood prior that it\nwas going to jail and offered no resistance.</p>\n\n<br />\nThe next morning we had planned on going to the jail solidarity resistance but had to leave\ntown for financial reasons. Upon leaving town we were told that the jail solidarity group had\nbeen infiltrated and brutalized by the police: 150 people sustained injuries from police\nbrutality. By the end of the weekend nearly 900 had been arrested, many more detained, and\nquite a few innocent bystanders had been harassed in the streets.\n\n<p>Whatever the level of police infiltration of the black bloc, one cannot doubt that the\npolice forces had not been beefed up with over a billion dollars just to stand around and\nprovide traffic control. All in all, we felt like the experience had been good for us\npersonally, but the demonstration had failed on many fronts. The black bloc is, in my view, a\nsymptom of the impasse of liberal street protests policed and organized by NGOs and\nbureaucratized unions. Legal protest with no confrontation whatsoever accomplishes very little\nin today's political environment, and while the black bloc produces terrible press, one cannot\ndeny that it did at least draw attention to the event and provide the image that this was a\nserious event rather than a normal protest. However, the bloc's tactics, without a mass base\nbehind them, amounted to little more than adventurist and moralistic property destruction. A\nmore valuable strategy of confrontation would have included leading large numbers of\nnon-violent protestors to the security fence, utilizing the powerful image of mass civil\ndisobedience to catapult the G20 into world headlines. Instead we had a tame legal protest\nsavaged by riot police who used the adventurist tactics of 100 or so black bloc protestors,\nwith very little media coverage other than endless replays of the same police cruiser\nexploding with the excessive use of words like \"thugs.\"</p>"], ["?Mubarak, Mubarak, What Have You Done??\n\n by Yasmine El Rashidi | NYRBlog\n\n | The New York Review of Books", "http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/feb/03/mubarak-mubarak-what-have-you-done/", "The New York Review of Books", "http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=irFhAzfu3RG_BLic_w6H4A", "<div id=\"blog-title\" class=\"hidden\">NYRblog : Roving thoughts and provocations from our\nwriters</div>\n\nComments   \n\n<h2><span class=\"quo\">'</span>Mubarak, Mubarak, What Have You Done?'</h2>\n\nProtesters gather on the front line between anti- and pro-Mubarak factions on the edge of\nTahrir Square as an Egyptian Army tank stands by, Cairo, February 3, 2011\n\n<p>On Tuesday, February 1, we headed to Tahrir Square for the \"million man\" march with some\napprehension. After a week of</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/jan/30/tomorrow-tahrir-again/\">growing\nprotests</a>, the military, which had arrived on Friday, had increased its presence in\ndowntown Cairo, and the perimeter of the square was now completely barricaded with concrete\nblocks and metal barriers. Just two narrow entryways had been left-each manned by a dozen\nsoldiers and just as many civilian volunteers. Despite the soldiers' promise not to use force,\nmany of us who entered the square wondered if they would trap us inside, and then, perhaps\neven shoot. By 4\n\nPM curfew set by the military-we knew no harm would come, and the protest turned into\nsomething of a festival.\n\n<p>The army and the protesters worked together to weed out infiltrators trying to stir up\ntrouble, and the crowd began chanting about the people and army being one. Estimates of the\nturnout varied, from one million to three. There was barely an empty square foot in the entire\nsquare and adjoining streets; people sang, played cards, shared meals, and later in the\nevening, began to talk of holding a soccer tournament, together with the army. One Al-Jazeera\ncorrespondent compared it to a rock concert. People spoke of feeling pride at being Egyptian,\nsome of them for the first time in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>There were still a few thousand people in Tahrir Square early Wednesday morning-mostly men,\nwho had remained following Tuesday's march. I had gone home Tuesday night after spending the\nday there, and my plan now was simply to drop by early to get a feel for the \"morning after.\"\nWhen I arrived at the square, I was checked thoroughly by four soldiers and five civilian\nvolunteers-three men and two veiled women. They searched my bag, gave me a pat down to insure\nI was not carrying a weapon, and asked for my</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">ID</span>. Eventually I was waved in, with a stern warning that any form of\nviolence or incitement would not be tolerated.\n\n<p>Many were still sleeping when I got there, just after 8</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">AM</span>: some on the grass with blankets over them; others in blue nylon\ncamping tents. A few were at the foot of the sand-colored army tanks that had been stationed\naround the square and were now covered with anti-Mubarak graffiti. In scattered corners,\nhundreds of others were having breakfast and had already resumed chanting for Mubarak to\nleave-taking turns at loudspeakers to come up with inventive new slogans. In one corner, by a\nmetro stop that has been closed for a week now, a gathering of 400 protesters recited\npoetry-their own, against the current regime. \"Mubarak, Mubarak,\" one of them repeated, \"what\nhave you done, look at the country, where art thou?\"\n\n<p>Intermittently, two young men who referred to themselves as \"The Organizing\nCommittee\"-self-appointed civilians who had already spent several nights in the square would\ntake the mike, and with husky voices, tired from days of chanting, call on the crowds to make\nthis ninth day of protest another peaceful one. No fighting, no arguing, and no tension-even\nif provoked. \"We are here as one. We are having a good time. We are well fed and we are\nunited-young, old, Christian, Muslim, men, women. We are simply Egyptians, and we want to show\nthe world what the Egyptian people are all about-peace and unity.\"</p>\n\n<p>People were clapping, beating on drums, and singing along to rhyming anti-Mubarak jokes and\nrefrains. (One dark one was about having to flee the country: \"Egyptair, Egyptair, business is\ngood, Mubarak's staying, so we all need flights.\") A few portable radios were on, tuned to the\nnews or playing popular Egyptian songs. Men and women were entering the square with bags\nfilled with food-breadsticks, packets of wafer biscuits, cartons of mango and guava juice. I\nrecognized one of the women, a historian and collector, carrying bottles of Nestle water.\nNearby, two young boys selling biscuits were arguing about how to divide their profits. A man\nnudged my shoulder, noticing my camera. Pointing to the picture of Mubarak strapped around his\nneck and marked with a red X, he took off his shoe, placed it on the president's head, and\nasked me to photograph him.</p>\n\nAn anti-Mubarak demonstrator<br />\n<br />\n   \n\n<p>One man called on the president to step down soon: \"Please, my arm is aching from holding\nup this sign,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>I circled Tahrir for awhile, chatting with protesters who in some cases had been there for\nthree or four days. \"If Mubarak does not leave, I will die on Tahrir's soil,\" one man shouted\nin my ear, wagging his finger, then pointing up to the circling military helicopter overhead,\nwaving it to go away. \"Take Mubarak with you, take Mubarak with you,\" the crowds shouted as it\ncircled lower and closer, observing them.</p>\n\n<p>No-one was satisfied with Mubarak's address to the nation the night before, in which he'd\npromised not to run in the September presidential elections, and the general sentiment was\nthat it was too little too late. Those gathered were already planning ahead for more nights in\nTahrir, and for this week's Friday prayer, discussing who would lead the sermon in the square\nand where exactly that imam-or civilian-would stand. Mubarak had said in his speech that he\nwould die on Egyptian soil; many of the people I talked to said they were prepared to die in\nTahrir Square if he didn't yield.</p>\n\n<p>When I left mid-morning, I began to sense that the day might take a turn for the worse. As\nI passed two army tanks that were blocking one of the roads I saw a shrieking woman in a\npurple veil take on a group of thirty protesters. \"You are ruining our country,\" she yelled.\n\"We had peace for thirty years, and in one week you have brought us to war. Mubarak is good.\nMubarak is the best.\" From a distance, the Organizing Committee called for the argument to be\nbroken up. A young man in a green 'Brazil' hoodie and black jeans jumped to the cause, taking\nthe woman's arm and asking her to calm down. He escorted her out of the square, and a human\nshield formed to prevent her from charging in again. \"What is happening,\" someone's voice\nechoed through a loud speaker, \"is that</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">NDP</span> people\"-i.e. from Mubarak's party-\"are trying to infiltrate the\ncrowds and cause conflict. We will not allow that. We respect everyone's opinions, but for\nthose who are pro-Mubarak, there are hundreds of other squares around the city for you to\noccupy-this one though, is ours.\" The voice then called on a group of two hundred men to block\na far passage into the square where pro-Mubarak protesters were rumoured to be approaching.\n\n<p>I turned around, and noticed the speaker point up to the monolithic building-the\ngovernment's administrative center known as the</p>\n\n<em>mugamma</em>-to his left. He asked the crowd to follow his finger, directed up at a corner\nof the roof. \"\n\n<span class=\"caps\">YOU</span>!\" he shouted. \"Yes you, in the dark glasses who we have seen\nevery day spy on us from above. You can go back and report to the president that we are not\ngoing anywhere, until he does.\" The crowd roared in applause. The\n\n<em>mugamma</em> has been closed for days now, shielded by the military, patrolled by\nsoldiers.\n\n<p>As I exited Tahrir, I noticed the pro-Mubarak crowds beginning to gather. Two hundred of\nthem stood at one of the main entry passages chanting against the opposition figure Mohamed\nElBaradei, calling him a traitor and spy. They heckled protesters entering the square in a\nsimilar way, trying to provoke a confrontation. After lingering a little, they followed me\ndown the Corniche in the direction of a rally, past the charred remains of the</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">NDP</span> headquarters, which had been burned over the weekend, past rows\nof tanks and soldiers, and on to the State\n\n<span class=\"caps\">TV</span> and Radio building, where several hundred more pro-Mubarak\nprotesters were already congregated, blasting the national anthem. There were some women among\nthem-one in a wheelchair, fuming, at what had become of the city-but mainly men: some\nteachers, some white-collar employees, and scores of lower-middle class men in their twenties.\n\n<p>My notebook gave me away, and they surrounded me-dozens of them-roughly demanding that I\ntake notes and report their accusations against the Tahrir protesters. I was pushed and shoved\nand someone spit in my face. Some of those around me seemed to have switched sides, moved by\nthe president's Tuesday speech. \"Please write,\" one man in his forties ordered me in broken\nEnglish, tapping his finger forcefully on my notebook. \"Mubarak, I am sorry. Please, forgive\nme. I am sorry.\" Others wanted me to document their conspiracy theories: In particular, that\nthe Muslim Brotherhood is funded by Iran, and that ElBaradei, who is known to have a villa in\nAustria and thought to have made a relative fortune from his</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">IAEA</span> post, pays anti-Mubarak protesters\n\n<span class=\"caps\">LE50</span> (about $9) a day to stay in the square. \"And they get free\n\nLE200 not <span class=\"caps\">LE50</span>.\" <br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>The pro-Mubarak crowd seemed tense, on the verge of rioting. Among them, I also spotted a\ndozen uniformed police-the same ones who had vanished from the streets after Friday's\nprotests-now cheering, dancing, being carried on people's shoulders wielding pro-Mubarak\nsigns. One of them looked wearily at me as I pointed my camera up at him. He seemed to direct\na soldier to me, who checked my journalist's card and gave me the '</p>\n\nPro-Mubarak demonstrators hoisting policemen on their shoulders<br />\n<br />\n\n<p>I managed to move away from the crowd, and as I walked home, I called a friend who hadn't\nyet been to the square that morning-Elijah Zarwan of the International Crisis Group-telling\nhim it felt like clashes were imminent. Newscasters on State</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">TV</span>, perhaps knowingly, had already issued warnings that violence\ncould erupt and urged citizens to stay home.\n\n<p>At 11:46 <span class=\"caps\">AM</span> the government restored Internet access-it had been\nblocked for six days, since midnight on Thursday-and warnings about violence were circulating\nthere too-on Facebook posts and Twitter feeds. We had all heard that pro-Mubarak protesters\nand thugs had been on the streets the night before, and an unofficial photocopied flyer had\nbeen circulating urging protesters to return home and accept Mubarak's concessions. It\nappeared to be a warning-I was not sure from whom. Things seemed on the brink.</p>\n\n<p>I had not been home for long before the first rocks were thrown in Tahrir Square around\n2.30</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">PM</span>. A friend called me immediately, reporting that he had been\nstruck in the back by one. I got a cab and rushed back toward the square, hopping out amid\nthousands of pro-Mubarak protesters on one of the bridges that lead into it. There were\nchildren and families, but mainly tough-looking young men, shouting at their adversaries-some\ninsults, some pro-Mubarak slogans, and many calls for them to get lost. The bridge was packed\nand from either side of it I could see hundreds, and then thousands, of pro-regime\ndemonstrators marching in from different directions. There were reported to be thousands more\napproaching the city. In their midst, again, were police, chanting along. Some soldiers stood\nnearby, in a human chain, casually watching the protesters approach.\n\nPro-Mubarak demonstrators massing on a bridge near Tahrir Square\n\n<p>I hurried through the masses of people until I reached the Egyptian Museum, which faces\nTahrir Square. There, some ten thousand pro-Mubarak protesters had gathered, and I noticed\nmany of them were carrying thick, long, wooden sticks. I tried to push further toward the\nscreaming I could hear coming from deeper in the square itself. I could also see smoke that\nlooked much like the fumes of the tear gas the security forces had fired on us days before. In\na split second things seemed to turn. The pro-Mubarak crowd in front of me lunged toward the\nprotesters inside the square, hurling stones, picking up debris from the ground and throwing\nit into the air. I ran to the side of the bridge by the museum, just missing a horse that came\ngalloping out from the crowds with a big man in his twenties. About a dozen more horses\nhurtled out. I also heard someone shout \"camel.\" It was a tactic we had never seen before.</p>\n\n<p>Someone screamed at me to get out of the way. The barricades the army had put up ahead of\nTuesday's march seemed to have been cleared, and now the soldiers, who had been friendly with\nthe protesters over the weekend, simply watched the pro-Mubarak demonstrators attack. I could\nhear piercing shrieks coming from further in the square. Pieces of metal and other debris\nseemed to be falling from the sky. Something seemed to be exploding, and I guessed it was\nshells of tear gas-it was a familiar sound. On the bridge above me, thousands of people had\ngathered to watch, standing on railings and shoulders. Men began to exit the crowds with their\nhands on their heads, covered in blood. People rushed in with tissues and water.</p>\n\n<p>A man stared at me and asked where I was from, why I had a camera, what I was doing with a\nnotebook. \"Those filthy foreigners and their reports,\" he said. I had heard that journalists\nwere being harassed, and I quelled the instinct to panic. I lingered at the bottom of the\nbridge and called a friend who had been on the \"anti-Mubarak\" side of the square. He said\nthere was still fighting and that he was stuck right in the center, unable to move. I wanted\nto</p>\n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/yasminerashidi\">tweet</a> about the situation, and reached into my\npocket for my phone. I had no chance-a round of gunfire went off just a few feet away. And\nthen more. Successive shots. It sounded close-and as if someone in the pro-Mubarak crowd was\naiming at the anti-Mubarak side of the square. People started to scream and run. A man pushed\nme forward, urging me to go up the bridge. A little boy tripped beside me, and his father\ngrabbed him by his middle and fled.\n\n<p>I managed to get away, and found myself back near the State</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">TV</span> building, once again surrounded by pro-Mubarak demonstrators who\nhad stationed themselves beneath Al-Jazeera's Cairo bureau next door, and were chanting\nmessages up to its reporters. I raced through the crowd, apprehensive that they too might be\narmed. My speed may have given me away, and a group of young men pointed at me and started to\nshout \"Spy! Traitor! Spy!\" I panicked, and tried to disappear into the thick of the crowd,\nemerging a few minutes later with an Egyptian flag hoisted high-my \"cover\" bought for $2 from\na young boy. Others in the crowd were holding flags, and it seemed to keep me safe. As I\nwalked up another bridge, I passed trucks carrying gangs of thugs- the same type we had seen\nin the\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/jan/30/tomorrow-tahrir-again/\">protests\nlast week</a>-being off-loaded onto the street. They had pro-Mubarak banners and were armed\nwith wooden and metal sticks. I caught a glimpse of a knife stuck in the back of one man's\ntrousers. They saw my flag, and waved me on.\n\n<p>By Wednesday evening, many of my friends were among thousands stuck in Tahrir, which was\nstill surrounded by pro-Mubarak armed men. Egypt's Minister of Health had reported that five\nhundred people were injured and one killed in Wednesday's afternoon violence-a figure he\nupdated Thursday to 8 deaths and 900 injuries. A friend-who saw it from an apartment\noverlooking the square-told me a fire had broken out on top of the Egyptian Museum. Activists\nwere posting Facebook updates by the second, when possible identifying those hurt or detained,\nand making urgent pleas for help-for medical supplies and to transport injured protesters to\nhospitals. I heard that a journalist I knew had been severely wounded. The defence ministry\nwas urging people to go home, and there were reports that armed men were circling Tahrir and\nfanning out across the city. In my neighborhood, the civilian patrols who have manned our\nstreets for the past week (using passwords, changed daily, to admit residents) had been warned\nthat the night would be rough.</p>\n\n<p>At around 1 <span class=\"caps\">AM</span> Thursday morning, there were reports of new\ngunfire and explosions in Tahrir. There was also shouting near my house, and someone was\nroaring into a loud speaker in the distance-I couldn't make out what. I could hear explosions\nsomewhere in the distance-perhaps across the river. A rumor spread that thugs would storm\nTahrir at dawn. There were already flames in the square, and pro-Mubarak men were hurling\nmolotov cocktails and glass at protesters from a bridge. Reports of protesters who had gone\nmissing-\"kidnapped,\"-began to come in on social networking sites. Some activists and civilian\nvolunteer patrols had managed to detain thugs and hand them over to the military. An activist\ntweeted, \"We find that every thug arrested has 'Police' written on his</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">ID</span>. Those are the only pro-Mubarak protesters\" Several confiscated\npolice IDs were\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/24271114@N08/sets/72157625838724811/\">posted on the\ninternet</a>. <br />\n<br />\n \n\n<p>My father, who lives in another central Cairo neighborhood called me early Thursday\nmorning, warning of the escalating violence downtown. A friend of his who tried to make her\nway over one of the bridges to Tahrir around 6</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">AM</span> had been stopped by armed thugs and warned to turn back if she\ncared for her life. I also learned that the 72-year-old father of a friend of mine had been\nhit by a stolen car filled with thugs in the middle of the night as he patrolled the streets\nwith other civilians, and is now in an\n\n<span class=\"caps\">ICU</span>. Reports of armed men around downtown were streaming in every\nminute.\n\n<p>Asked what it would do to quell the violence, the government only said, \"we will invite,\nand re-invite, opposition parties to the negotiating table for discussions.\" On State</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">TV</span>, which seemed to be broadcasting events from a parallel universe,\nthe pro-Mubarak protesters were being depicted as \"pro stability.\" I got news that the deputy\nhead of the Egyptian state channel Nile\n\n<span class=\"caps\">TV</span> had resigned half way through the day-unable, she said, to feed\nthe government's lies. There was much talk, meanwhile, about who was behind the pro-regime\nmayhem. Even though some people attribute it broadly to the \"government,\" many believe it has\nperhaps been orchestrated by former minister of the interior Habib El Adly and leading members\nof the ruling National Democratic Party-in particular businessmen, who have benefited greatly\nfrom the regime. Among the\n\n<span class=\"caps\">NDP</span> strongmen often mentioned is Ahmad Ezz, who is suspected by many\nof having manipulated and financed the rigged parliamentary elections in November. There had\nalso been hired thugs out during those elections and the\n\n<span class=\"caps\">NDP</span> is known to have unleashed hundreds of them to ensure victory.\n\nThe charred headquarters of the ruling NDP party<br />\n<br />\n  \n\n<p>Many people I am in touch with have been trying to get food and medical supplies into\nTahrir since early Thursday morning, but most routes in are now blocked by thugs. \"Everywhere\nI turn I find men with knives and guns,\" a friend who was heading there by car with supplies\ntold me at 9</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">AM</span>. On Facebook, friends and activists are posting feeds: \"5 of my\njournalist friends have been beaten and had their equipment confiscated. The pro-mubarak thugs\nare targeting journalists.\" And another: \"Friend was trying to deliver medical supplies, they\nsmashed his car and he had to turn\n\n<span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> run away #Jan25\". As gunshots and machine-gun fire are reported\nacross the city, hospital workers describe overwhelming numbers of people coming in with\nconcussions, internal bleedings, and third-degree burns. One activist tweets, \"We've lost 10\nEgyptians in the first gulf war in '91 and 307 in our war with Mubarak. #egypt.\"\n\n<p>Aida Seif El Dawla, the human rights activist who runs the downtown El Nadim Centre for\nvictims of violence, has been posting news of kidnappings, injuries, and deaths. At 12:16</p>\n\n<span class=\"caps\">PM</span> she writes, \"Watching Mubarak's terrorism first hand from the\nwindow. Officer supervising the violence.\" At 4\n\n<span class=\"caps\">PM</span> a friend called from downtown. He was out of breath and\npanicking-he had just seen a group of thugs drag a foreign-looking man down the street,\nbeating him, accusing him of being an Israeli spy.\n\ntweets: \"Tomorrow, Anger Friday.

They hijack attention away from the issue that turned\nout thousands of people and refocus it on the destructive behavior of a few individuals. It\ndoesn't matter that the protest violence pales in comparison to the state violence of\neducation cuts or that the protest violence was directed at property and the state violence is\ndirected at people. The average person simply will not see it that way. They will believe the\nstudents to be crazy and dismiss their struggle. Furthermore, it will only mean tougher\npolicing of the peaceful activists the next time they stage a march.\n\n, addressing some of these points:<br />\n<br />\n \n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our membership rightly wanted and expected an opportunity to peacefully express their\ngrievances and it was our responsibility to help deliver that. We worked closely with the\npolice and authorities to agree the route and logistics to hold the powerful and emphatic but\nnonviolent protest on a crisp but sunny November lunchtime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was not only the weather that was on our side.</p>\n\nWe had the economic case on our side for funding our future: all but two other OECD countries\nare investing in the education and skills they need to recover and flourish - the UK and\nRomania stand alone in cutting back, and a hike in fees would render our public universities\nthe most expensive in the world for students.\n\n<p>We had the politics on our side: the only way the tripling of fees and irrational cuts to\ncolleges and universities can be implemented is if politicians break the promises they made to\nvoters, many of whom were present in Westminster yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>We have culture on our side: the government's cuts would remove all public funding for\narts, humanities and social sciences in universities and devalue our further- and\nhigher-education system in the process.</p>\n\n<p>And we have public opinion on our side: more than 70% of the public oppose plans to triple\nstudent fees according to the latest opinion polls. In unity, we convened the biggest student\ndemonstration this century. We had right on our side and huge support to spur us on. Our case\nwas right and it was overwhelming. It remains so.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most inspiring conversations I had yesterday were with parents who had only\nheard about the demonstration on the morning's news and felt they had to be there to support\ntheir sons and daughters on the march. They came, they saw and they marched together with\nus.</p>\n\nvery small minority of violent protesters - estimated at 200 - who sought to hijack our\norganised success for their own agendas. The organisers of this splinter action are not known\nto us but we suspect they are not even students. I make no apology for condemning the mindless\nviolence of a few that tried to undermine the case of a great many. I wish that rather than\nspend so much of our time talking about that reckless minority that we had more opportunity to\ntalk about the real issues that brought so many people out on the streets.\n\n<p>That violence by a tiny minority sought to detract from our powerful collective message and\nlet students down. We will never defend those who took actions that put innocent people's\nlives at risk. Indeed, I notice that none of those who unleashed violence on innocent people\nhave been willing to comment in public.

Following the release of a U.S. State Dept. travel advisory\nfor the area, the students had their studies cut short and were relocated temporarily to\nBarcelona on Feb. 1. They were a semester into their year-long program at the American\nUniversity in Cairo - located about 45 minutes by car from Tahrir Square. Since their\nevacuation, three of the students returned to California, while two opted to transfer to the\nHebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<br />\n This is their story:<br />\n<br />\n<p><strong>The \"Rage Revolution\" Begins</strong></p>\n\n<br />\n Spurred by mass protests in Tunisia that led to the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine\nBen Ali, demonstrations erupted across the Middle East, sparking in Egypt on Jan. 25. Tens of\nthousands of protesters assembled in Cairo that day, demanding the end of President Mubarak's\nregime.\n\n<br />\n UCSB students Hodge and Sophie Tahran along with alumnus Brendan Geck were present in Tahrir\nSquare for the first day of protests.\n\n<br />\n Geck and Hodge were rooming together near Tahrir Square on the island of Zamalek and\ninitially intended to watch the protests from afar. However, Geck said, they ultimately became\nimmersed in the conflict.\n\n<br />\n \"It was primarily peaceful for the first four hours we were there, maybe around 4:30, 5 p.m.,\n[when] tensions began to build between the protesters and police,\" Geck said in a webcam\ninterview.\n\n<br />\n The conflict escalated when police began firing tear gas and rubber bullets and using batons,\nshields and water hoses to push back the demonstrators. Thousands of people then began rushing\nthe police. Geck was hit with rubber pellets when he approached the protesters to take\npictures of the scene.\n\n<br />\n Hodge said he was stunned that Egyptians were so resolute in their demands.\n\n<br />\n \"I was shocked by the Egyptians' courage and ability to pull this off, as up until now most\npeople, including myself and most Egyptians, had characterized Egyptians as incredibly\napathetic,\" Hodge said in a Facebook message. \"Until all this, that was kind of their\nreputation in the Middle East amongst other Arab nationalities.\"\n\n<br />\n Dalia Ziada, an Egyptian human rights activist and outreach director for the American Islamic\nCongress, said she was happy to discover the strength of her countrymen.\n\n<br />\n \"Before the protests started, we were hopeful, but never thought that it would come true,\"\nZiada said from Egypt via Skype. \"On the first day, everyone was surprised by the huge number\nof crowds. There are so many people that tend to be passive. Now there are no passive people\nanymore.\"\n\n<br />\n Hodge said the country's volatile economic and political climate, brusquely handled by the\nsame dictator for three decades, had steeped tensions among the Egyptian people.\n\n<br />\n \"In addition to the fact that there is high unemployment caused by the fact that after\ngraduating from college ? they are unable to find jobs because most people attain degrees in\nuseless fields such as [pharaonic] history (in Egypt, the government chooses your major based\noff some test), high food prices and ridiculously high levels of corruption - politically the\nlast round of parliamentary elections were more rigged than usual,\" he said.\n\n<p><strong>\"Day of Revolt\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Three days in, protests took a drastically violent turn. With media reporting over 20\nprotesters killed that day and dozens more injured, the Egyptian military felt compelled to\nintervene.</p>\n\n<br />\n \"It started to look more like a war zone,\" Geck said. \"The military stepped in on Friday\n[Jan. 28]. That's when the prospect of a revolution began to be possible.\"\n\n<br />\n That same day, the government blocked internet access and cell phone service to the majority\nof the country.\n\n<br />\n Tahran, a third-year global studies major, witnessed pandemonium on the fourth day of\ndemonstrations. She visited Tahrir Square as she returned from the train station that day and\nfound herself trapped. Tahran said she tried to leave the square as struggles escalated\nbetween protesters and police, but her exit routes were blocked.\n\n<br />\n \"I tried to get on the metro and my stop wasn't working,\" she said in a webcam interview. \"I\nwent to another stop and that wasn't functioning either. Police were blocking the bridge that\nwould allow me to get home. As we walked closer we saw that the protesters were assembled near\nmy block.\"\n\n<br />\n As tear gas spread through the air, creating clouds of white billowing smoke, she and her\nfriend hurried to find another way to their off-campus apartment.\n\n<br />\n \"Tear gas was being blown by the wind toward us,\" she said. \"We were luckily able to cross\nanother bridge. We found a cab driver who was willing to take us home through the back\nstreets.\"\n\n<br />\n Tahran said she saw authorities being carried away by protesters and an apartment lit on\nfire, undercut with a current of tear gas.\n\n<br />\n \"It was mostly just people fainting because of the tear gas,\" she said. \"We were 300 feet\naway [from] the conflict and the tear gas was still affecting us.\"\n\n<br />\n As Tahran and a friend struggled to get to their apartment, Geck, Hodge and their friend were\nescorted out of the conflict zone and sent away on a river boat by police officers. Hodge said\nEgyptian authorities were concerned that the American students would take pictures or cause\ninternational repercussions.\n\n<br />\n Hodge's group sought shelter on the fourth floor of the Ramses Hilton, providing them a\nvantage point of the protests. However, Hodge said, the tear gas was so strong that the hotel\nstaff forced observers off the pool deck and barricaded the hotel - locking everyone in.\n\n<br />\n Geck was separated from the group during the commotion and blocked outside the hotel. As he\nstumbled to find refuge, Geck said he witnessed police throwing rocks at protesters and\nlighting cars on fire to frame demonstrators. While dodging Molotov cocktails, he eventually\nfound a parking lot to take shelter, struggling against pervasive tear gas.\n\n<br />\n \"I had probably the worst experience of tear gas from the whole trip,\" he said. \"I felt\npinned down for a second, then found a parking garage.\"\n\n<br />\n Geck said he never feared for his life; he was afraid of getting arrested while hiding out in\nthe garage.\n\n<br />\n \"I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see, I didn't know what was going on,\" Geck said. \"I had\nheard people say that the police were coming. That's when you run the risk of getting\narrested.\"\n\n<br />\n Meanwhile, protesters broke through the barricade and rushed into the Ramses Hilton.\n\n<br />\n \"They were peaceful though and mostly were just there to rest and recover from the violence\nwhich was directly outside,\" Hodge said. \"Throughout the day tear gas seeped into the hotel\nwhich we all eventually became used to and by 10:30 [p.m.] it was safe for us to walk home\nagain as the protesters had beaten off the cops when they got help from the army who diffused\nthe situation.\"\n\n<br />\n As soon as he learned that the army had stepped in to protect the Egyptian people, Geck said\nhe knew that protest had become revolution.\n\n<p><strong>The Jan. 29 and Jan. 30 Demonstrations</strong></p>\n\n<p>Geoff Cloepfil, a fourth-year linguistics major, said the entire square and all of its\nconnecting streets were filled with people and military tanks on Jan. 29, although armed\nforces reportedly defied Mubarak's orders to open fire on unarmed protesters.</p>\n\n<br />\n \"People were standing on top of tanks waving flags and shouting anti-Mubarak slogans,\"\nCloepfil said. \"At one point I saw an army officer lifted to shoulder level, parading through\nthe square while leading people in a chant. At that point everything was still peaceful,\ndespite the scent of tear gas still in the air from the previous day. We were evacuated ?\nbefore things turned really violent.\"\n\n<br />\n Most service members and police officers left the city the following day, prompting the\ncommunity to close all businesses and assemble neighborhood watches for looters.\n\n<br />\n \"The thing that affected me most was how people were able to come together,\" Tahran said.\n\"For a few days there was no authority at all. People stepped out to the plate and took\ncharge. ? All the men on my street stood out all night with kitchen utensils, protecting their\nproperty [and] family.\"\n\n<br />\n Hodge said there were only three bridges to Zamalek island where he, Geck, Tahran and\nCloepfil lived, making it easily defensible.\n\n<br />\n \"At each bridge there were checkpoints manned by about 100 men, most of whom had long metal\npoles or machetes, but some of whom had AK-47's and bulletproof vests,\" he said via Facebook.\n\"After curfew (4 p.m.) no women would be seen out on the streets, only these armed men, who\ndepending on the day wear either white or yellow armbands as a way of identifying themselves\nas being from Zamalek.\"\n\n<br />\n While students living in off-campus dorms or apartments in Zamalek were located near the\nheart of the protests, the rest of the student body was more removed from the conflict. Still,\nElise Bell, a third-year cultural anthropology major, was living on-campus at the American\nUniversity in Cairo and said she felt the revolution's impact trickle down to the university.\n\n<br />\n \"It started getting difficult getting food and water,\" Bell said. \"The dorms never ran out of\nfood, but there were hour-and-a-half long lines in the supermarket. Everyone was hoarding\nfood, in case they weren't allowed to leave.\"\n\n<br />\n Bell was visiting her family in California when the protests first erupted during the\nuniversity's winter break. She returned to Cairo two days after the protests, but was\nevacuated to Barcelona shortly after.\n\n<br />\n Vivian Chui, a third-year Middle Eastern studies major, on the other hand, was out of Egypt\nduring the whole incident. Chui said she was supposed to return to Cairo on Jan. 28 before her\nspring semester commenced on Jan. 31, but cancelled her flight as the protests became more\nviolent.\n\n<br />\n She remained with her host family in Beirut, where she was traveling during the break.\n\n<p><strong>Leaving Egypt</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many of the students didn't find out about their mandatory evacuation until hours before\ntheir scheduled flight on Feb. 1.</p>\n\n<br />\n \"We were pulled from Egypt completely out of the blue,\" Tahran said. \"I literally got a call\nat 3 in the morning and got picked up at 9.\"\n\n<br />\n Cloepfil said he was upset by the call to evacuate.<br />\n \"I was in Egypt during a revolution,\" he said. \"I wanted to experience it. I tried everything\nI could to convince them to let me stay, but in the end didn't get to have a choice.\"\n\n<br />\n After being pulled from Egypt, the students were allowed to choose whether they wanted to\nreturn to the U.S. or transfer to Israel, Turkey, Korea or Germany, to continue their studies.\n\n<br />\n Tahran said she had only 10 minutes to choose a destination. While she and Hodge chose\nJerusalem, Cloepfil selected Korea. However, visa complications prevented him from travelling\nto Seoul. Bell and Chui returned to California and Geck decided to leave Egypt on Feb. 8 to\njoin his friends and accept a job opportunity in Jerusalem.\n\n<br />\n As the students left Cairo, officers and \"thugs\" dressed in street clothes reportedly\nattempted to scare protesters into submission. Posing as supporters of the regime, some\npro-Mubarak forces reportedly traveled on camel and horseback while firing live ammunition at\nanti-government protesters.\n\n<p><strong>\"Free at Last\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>After 18 days of protests, Mubarak resigned from office on Feb. 11 and transferred power to\nthe Supreme Council of Egyptian Armed Forces. The interim government has since appointed a\ncommittee of legal experts to amend the Egyptian constitution so that it includes term limits\non the presidency and regulates government power.</p>\n\n<br />\n Presidential elections are prospectively scheduled for August.\n\n<br />\n Geck said he was elated by the news of Mubarak's resignation. However, he was also upset to\nmiss the historic event by a mere 28 hours.\n\n<br />\n Hodge said he originally thought that day would never come.\n\n<br />\n \"With regards to Hosni Mubarak's resignation, if you had asked me the day before the protests\nbegan, or even a week after they had got under way if I thought it would ever happen, I would\nhave said no,\" he said on Feb. 14. \"However, lately, especially in the last week, I came to\nexpect this more and more.\"\n\n<br />\n Bell said she was surprised that Mubarak stepped down without a larger fight.\n\n<br />\n \"I thought he would hold out longer,\" Bell said. \"I really thought he would hold out until\nthey physically removed him from the country.\"\n\n<br />\n Although happy, Cloepfil said he is concerned for the country's future.\n\n<br />\n \"The majority of Egyptians I talked to wanted Mubarak to step down immediately, but had no\nidea of where to go from there,\" Cloepfil said. \"In this sort of situation, it's so easy for\nanother dictator to just fill the vacuum.\"\n\n<br />\n Chui said she couldn't help but adopt the Egyptian people's cynicism about their government\nafter her time in the country.\n\n<br />\n \"Walking around the first night, police officers would roam street corners with large\nrifles,\" Chui said. \"It was never on the actual news, but I heard that someone was tortured in\na police station. ? As a foreigner, they treat you so well, but not when you're an Egyptian.\"\n\n<br />\n Although a final death count has not been announced, Egyptian Health Minister Ahmed Sameh\nFarid estimated on Feb. 23 that 384 people died and 6,467 sustained injuries during the 18-day\nconflict between civilians and police forces.\n\n<br />\n Despite this startling statistic, the demonstrations have been described as largely\nnon-violent in nature.\n\n<br />\n Ziada, who has participated in numerous women's rights movements, said Egyptian society has a\nlong history of struggling for equality amidst injustice.\n\n<br />\n \"I was surprised with how [the protesters] were tolerant in dealing with other groups,\" Ziada\nsaid. \"Although we were complaining about sexual corruption to women, there were thousands of\nwomen and thousands of men and they never got harassed. This was due to the government\nsuppression of people.\"\n\n<br />\n A strong proponent of non-violent reform, Ziada translated an American comicbook about Martin\nLuther King Jr.'s peaceful protests in Montgomery, Alab. into Arabic. Ziada and other\nactivists distributed these comics in Tahrir Square to discourage violence. Aside from\npromoting peace, the pamphlets also allowed activists to reach protestors at a time when the\ngovernment was censoring media outlets.\n\n<br />\n \"We found great difficulty [publishing the book],\" Ziada said. \"Security forces here didn't\nwant us to have it printed. We were distributing it everywhere in the country, the Middle East\nas well. We give training on how to use nonviolent tactics in breaking down a dictator.\"\n\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whether they chose to travel abroad in Egypt to enrich their Arabic language skills, study\nMiddle Eastern relations or simply live in one of the world's most culturally and historically\nrich countries, the students present during the protests watched history unfold before their\neyes. Regardless of what lessons they took with them, the students said they would never\nforget the Egyptian people, whom they described as compassionate, hospitable and joyful.</p>\n\n<br />\n \"We learned about the lack of political process that exists, the type of underlying conflict\nthat exists when people are unable to express themselves through elections,\" Geck said. \"I had\nnever seen people that excited, that passionate.\"\n\n<br />\n As they witnessed the collapse of a dictatorship and learned about the slew of revolts that\nerupted in the Middle East as a result, the students said they fully grasped their\ngeneration's ability to initiate change.\n\nPortrayal of Violence in Middle East Impedes Political Attempts at Peace\n\nBiased Media Representation Draws Incomplete Picture of Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"]]
